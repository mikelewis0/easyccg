Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and cell proliferation .
In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for CD28-mediated activation of the NF-kappa B/CD28-responsive complex and IL-2 expression .
Delineation of the CD28 signaling cascade was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity , followed by the activation of phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase .
Our data suggest that lipoxygenase metabolites activate ROI formation which then induce IL-2 expression via NF-kappa B activation .
These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the CD28 costimulatory pathway .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV-2 ) , like HIV-1 , causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa .
HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease .
Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer/promoter region of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1 .
Whereas activation of the HIV-1 enhancer following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis-acting elements : a single kappa B site , two purine-rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site .
We have now identified a novel cis-acting element within the HIV-2 enhancer , immediately upstream of the kappa B site , designated peri-kappa B .
This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus , and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but not T-cell lines .
This is the first description of an HIV-2 enhancer element which displays such monocyte specificity , and no comparable enhancer element has been clearly defined for HIV-1 .
While a nuclear factor ( s ) from both peripheral blood monocytes and T cells binds the peri-kappa B site , electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that either a different protein binds to this site in monocytes versus T cells or that the protein recognizing this enhancer element undergoes differential modification in monocytes and T cells , thus supporting the transfection data .
Further , while specific constitutive binding to the peri-kappa B site is seen in monocytes , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding .
Understanding the monocyte-specific function of the peri-kappa B factor may ultimately provide insight into the different role monocytes and T cells play in HIV pathogenesis .
Adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and E1A transfection were used to model changes in susceptibility to NK cell killing caused by transient vs stable E1A expression in human cells .
Only stably transfected target cells exhibited cytolytic susceptibility , despite expression of equivalent levels of E1A proteins in Ad-infected targets .
The inability of E1A gene products to induce cytolytic susceptibility during infection was not explained by an inhibitory effect of viral infection on otherwise susceptible target cells or by viral gene effects on class I MHC antigen expression on target cells .
This differential effect of E1A expression on the cytolytic phenotypes of infected and stably transfected human cells suggests that human NK cells provide an effective immunologic barrier against the in vivo survival and neoplastic progression of E1A-immortalized cells that may emerge from the reservoir of persistently infected cells in the human host .
The CD4 coreceptor interacts with non-polymorphic regions of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and contributes to T cell activation .
We have investigated the effect of CD4 triggering on T cell activating signals in a lymphoma model using monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) which recognize different CD4 epitopes .
We demonstrate that CD4 triggering delivers signals capable of activating the NF-AT transcription factor which is required for interleukin-2 gene expression .
Whereas different anti-CD4 mAb or HIV-1 gp120 could all trigger activation of the protein tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn and phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein , which mediates signals to Ras , they differed significantly in their ability to activate NF-AT .
Lack of full activation of NF-AT could be correlated to a dramatically reduced capacity to induce calcium flux and could be complemented with a calcium ionophore .
The results identify functionally distinct epitopes on the CD4 coreceptor involved in activation of the Ras/protein kinase C and calcium pathways .
High-dose estrogen administration induces anemia in mammals .
In chickens , estrogens stimulate outgrowth of bone marrow-derived erythroid progenitor cells and delay their maturation .
This delay is associated with down-regulation of many erythroid cell-specific genes , including alpha- and beta-globin , band 3 , band 4.1 , and the erythroid cell-specific histone H5 .
We show here that estrogens also reduce the number of erythroid progenitor cells in primary human bone marrow cultures .
To address potential mechanisms by which estrogens suppress erythropoiesis , we have examined their effects on GATA-1 , an erythroid transcription factor that participates in the regulation of the majority of erythroid cell-specific genes and is necessary for full maturation of erythrocytes .
We demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of GATA-1 is strongly repressed by the estrogen receptor ( ER ) in a ligand-dependent manner and that this repression is reversible in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen .
ER-mediated repression of GATA-1 activity occurs on an artificial promoter containing a single GATA-binding site , as well as in the context of an intact promoter which is normally regulated by GATA-1 .
GATA-1 and ER bind to each other in vitro in the absence of DNA .
In coimmunoprecipitation experiments using transfected COS cells , GATA-1 and ER associate in a ligand-dependent manner .
Mapping experiments indicate that GATA-1 and the ER form at least two contacts , which involve the finger region and the N-terminal activation domain of GATA-1 .
We speculate that estrogens exert effects on erythropoiesis by modulating GATA-1 activity through protein-protein interaction with the ER .
We have shown that interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) and IL-2 control IL-2 receptor alpha ( IL-2R alpha ) gene transcription in CD4-CD8-murine T lymphocyte precursors .
Here we map the cis-acting elements that mediate interleukin responsiveness of the mouse IL-2R alpha gene using a thymic lymphoma-derived hybridoma ( PC60 ) .
The transcriptional response of the IL-2R alpha gene to stimulation by IL-1 + IL-2 is biphasic .
IL-1 induces a rapid , protein synthesis-independent appearance of IL-2R alpha mRNA that is blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappa B activation .
It also primes cells to become IL-2 responsive and thereby prepares the second phase , in which IL-2 induces a 100-fold further increase in IL-2R alpha transcripts .
Transient transfection experiments show that several elements in the promoter-proximal region of the IL-2R alpha gene contribute to IL-1 responsiveness , most importantly an NF-kappa B site conserved in the human and mouse gene .
IL-2 responsiveness , on the other hand , depends on a 78-nucleotide segment 1.3 kilobases upstream of the major transcription start site .
This segment functions as an IL-2-inducible enhancer and lies within a region that becomes DNase I hypersensitive in normal T cells in which IL-2R alpha expression has been induced .
IL-2 responsiveness requires three distinct elements within the enhancer .
Two of these are potential binding sites for STAT proteins .
This review focuses on the roles of transcription factors in hematopoietic lineage commitment .
A brief introduction to lineage commitment and asymmetric cell division is followed by a discussion of several methods used to identify transcription factors important in specifying hematopoietic cell types .
Next is presented a discussion of the use of embryonic stem cells in the analysis of hematopoietic gene expression and the use of targeted gene disruption to analyze the role of transcription factors in hematopoiesis .
Finally , the status of our current knowledge concerning the roles of transcription factors in the commitment to erythroid , myeloid and lymphoid cell types is summarized .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is known to infect B cells and epithelial cells .
We and others have shown that EBV can also infect a subset of thymocytes .
Infection of thymocytes was accompanied by the appearance of linear EBV genome within 8 hr of infection .
Circularization of the EBV genome was not detected .
This is in contrast to the infection in B cells where the genome can circularize within 24 hr of infection .
The appearance of the BamHI ZLF-1 gene product , ZEBRA , by RT-PCR , was observed within 8 hr of infection .
The appearance of a novel fusion transcript ( RAZ ) , which comprised regions of the BZLF-1 locus and the adjacent BRLF-1 locus , was detected by RT-PCR .
ZEBRA protein was also identified in infected thymocytes by immunoprecipitation .
In addition , we demonstrated that the EBNA-1 gene in infected thymocytes was transcribed from the Fp promoter , rather than from the Cp/Wp promoter which is used in latently infected B cells .
Transcripts encoding gp350/220 , the major coat protein of EBV , were identified , but we did not find any evidence of transcription from the LMP-2A or EBER-1 loci in infected thymocytes .
These observations suggest that de novo EBV infection of thymocytes differs from infection of B cells .
The main difference is that with thymocytes , no evidence could be found that the virus ever circularizes .
Rather , EBV remains in a linear configuration from which replicative genes are transcribed .
A key cytokine induced during the immune response is IL-2 .
Following T cell activation , the genes encoding IL-2 and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced .
In turn , secreted IL-2 serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes .
Several recent studies have implicated Jak kinases in the signaling pathway induced by IL-2 .
Following this lead , we set out to identify transcription factors induced in response to IL-2 .
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed to contain several IL-2-inducible DNA binding activities .
Similar activities were also observed in a transformed human lymphocyte line , termed YT .
We have purified these activities and found that the principal IL-2-inducible component bears significant relatedness to a prolactin-induced transcription factor first identified in sheep mammary gland tissue .
We hypothesize that activation of this protein , designated hStat5 , helps govern the biological effects of IL-2 during the immune response .
The cell cycle-dependent transcription factor , E2F-1 , regulates the cyclin-like species of the DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase ( UDG ) gene in human osteosarcoma ( Saos-2 ) cells .
We demonstrate , through the deletion of the human UDG promoter sequences , that expression of E2F-1 activates the UDG promoter through several E2F sites .
The major putative downstream site for E2F , located in the first exon , serves as a target for E2F-1/DP1 complex binding in vitro .
We also provide evidence for the functional relationship between the cyclin-like UDG gene product and E2F .
High levels of UDG expression in a transient transfection assay result in the down-regulation of transcriptional activity through elements specific for E2F-mediated transcription .
Overexpression of UDG in Saos 2 cells was observed to delay growth late in G1 phase and transiently arrest these cells from progressing into the S phase .
This hypothetical model integrates one mechanism of DNA repair with the cell cycle control of gene transcription , likely through E2F .
This implicates E2F as a multifunctional target for proteins and enzymes , possibly , responsive to DNA damage through the negative effect of UDG on E2F-mediated transcriptional activity .
Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) is an important immunoregulatory protein produced predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes ( LGL ) in response to different extracellular signals .
In particular , two interleukins ( ILs ) , IL-2 and IL-12 , have been shown to be potent inducers of IFN-gamma gene expression in both T cells and LGL .
Although it has been reported that there are some T cell lines that produce IFN-gamma in response to IL-2 and IL-12 stimulation , there has as yet been no report of a natural killer ( NK ) cell line that responds in a similar manner .
In this report we present evidence that the cell line NK3.3 derived from human NK cells , responds to both IL-2 and IL-12 , as measured by increases in IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) cytoplasmic mRNA and protein expression .
In addition , when used together IL-2 and IL-12 synergized in the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF and this synergy was attributed to an increased accumulation and stability of the IFN-gamma and GM-CSF mRNAs .
To investigate the signaling pathways involved in the gene induction , five inhibitors , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , transforming growth factor-beta , cycloheximide , genistein , and staurosporine A , were used in analyzing the effects of IL-2 and IL-12 on NK3.3 cells .
The results suggest that activation of protein kinase C , but not new protein synthesis , is required for IL-2 induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF cytoplasmic mRNA .
In contrast , IL-12 induction of IFN-gamma cytoplasmic mRNA appears to only partially depend on activation of protein kinase C .
Furthermore , both transforming growth factor-beta and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , could suppress IL-2 and IL-12 signaling but CsA was generally inactive .
It also was observed that suppression of cytokine gene expression by these agents was independent of the inhibition of proliferation .
In addition , IL-2 but not IL-12 induced nuclear factors NF-kappa B and AP1 , and regulation of the nuclear levels of these two DNA binding protein complexes is correlated with IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression .
These data indicate that IL-2 and IL-12 may have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF gene expression , and that the NK3.3 cell line may serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways .
Stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) induces activation of multiple tyrosine kinases , resulting in phosphorylation of numerous intracellular substrates .
One substrate is p95vav , which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic and trophoblast cells .
It contains a number of structural motifs , including Src homology 2 , Src homology 3 , and pleckstrin homology domains and a putative guanine nucleotide exchange domain .
The role of p95vav in TCR-mediated signaling processes is unclear .
Here , we show that overexpression of p95vav alone in Jurkat T cells leads to activation of the nuclear factors , including NFAT , involved in interleukin-2 expression .
Furthermore , p95vav synergizes with TCR stimulation in inducing NFAT- and interleukin-2-dependent transcription .
In contrast , NFAT activation by a G-protein-coupled receptor is not modulated by p95vav overexpression , suggesting that the effect is specific to the TCR signaling pathways .
Although removal of the first 67 amino acids of p95vav activates its transforming potential in NIH 3T3 cells , this region appears to be required for its function in T cells .
We further demonstrate that the p95vav-induced NFAT activation is not mimicked by Ras activation , though its function is dependent upon Ras and Raf .
Furthermore , the activating function of p95vav is blocked by FK506 , suggesting that its activity also depends on calcineurin .
To further dissect p95vav involvement in TCR signaling , we analyzed various Jurkat mutants deficient in TCR signaling function or TCR expression and showed that an intact TCR signaling pathway is required for p95vav to function .
However , overexpression of p95vav does not appear to influence TCR-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation or increases in cytoplasmic free calcium .
Taken together , our data suggest that p95vav plays an important role at an yet unidentified proximal position in the TCR signaling cascade .
The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene promoter contains a consensus sequence for the polyomavirus enhancer binding-protein 2 ( PEBP2 ) transcription factor , which consists of alpha and beta subunits .
There are at least two genes , alpha A and alpha B , encoding the alpha subunit .
alpha B is the mouse homologue of human AML1 gene detected at the breakpoints of t ( 8 ; 21 ) and t ( 3 ; 21 ) myeloid leukemias .
We examined alpha A1 ( an alpha A-gene product ) and alpha B1 and alpha B2 ( two alpha B-encoded isomers ) for their effects on the GM-CSF promoter .
PEBP2 alpha A1 , alpha B1 , and alpha B2 proteins bound the PEBP2 site within the mouse GM-CSF promoter .
PEBP2 alpha A1 and alpha B1 enhanced the expression of the GM-CSF promoter-driven reporter plasmid in unstimulated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate/phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human Jurkat T cells .
In contrast , the promoter activity was suppressed by alpha B2 .
Coexpression of alpha B1 and alpha B2 showed that the promoter activity could be determined by the alpha B1/alpha B2 ratio .
Jurkat cell extract contained PEBP2 site-binding protein ( s ) that cross-reacted with antimouse alpha A1 antibodies .
Northern blot analysis indicated the expression of human PEBP2 alpha A , alpha B ( AML1 ) , and beta genes in Jurkat cells .
Although further studies are required to determine the precise role of PEBP2 in the GM-CSF promoter activity , the present findings suggested the importance of the relative ratio of different PEBP2 isoforms in regulating the levels of the promoter activity .
The induction of cytokine expression in monocytes /macrophages by bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide is a critical , highly regulated host defence response .
The augmentation of LPS responses by interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , referred to as priming , is well established .
However , the mechanism ( s ) by which priming occurs is poorly defined .
Using tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) induction as a model , experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the LPS response in human monocytes .
Priming by IFN-gamma was primarily manifested at the level of TNF mRNA accumulation .
IFN-gamma pre-treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the LPS response .
Priming occurred after several hours of treatment , and the primed state was induced by either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF , but not M-CSF .
Primed monocytes transcribed TNF mRNA at a higher rate than freshly isolated monocytes upon activation with LPS .
The increased transcriptional rate correlated with a marked increase in nuclear factor-kappa B activity in these cells as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a consensus NF-kappa B oligonucleotide .
An additional significant finding was than TNF mRNA induced in primed cells was much more stable than in unprimed cells ( T1/2 increased 6-8-fold ) .
Consistent with the increased mRNA stability , the duration of mRNA accumulation was longer following LPS stimulation in primed monocytes , in addition to being of greater magnitude .
Finally , primed and unprimed cells possessed a differential sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor H-89 .
H-89 substantially suppressed LPS-induced TNF mRNA accumulation in unprimed cells , but had no effect on primed monocytes following LPS stimulation .
The CD4 promoter plays an important role in the developmental control of CD4 transcription .
In this report , we show that the minimal CD4 promoter has four factor binding sites , each of which is required for full function .
Using biochemical and mutagenesis analyses , we determined that multiple nuclear factors bind to these independent sites .
We determined that an initiator-like sequence present at the cap site and an Ets consensus sequence are required for full promoter function .
We also demonstrate that the Myc-associated zinc finger protein ( MAZ ) appears to be the predominant factor binding to one of these sites .
This last site closely resembles the ME1a1 G3AG4AG3 motif previously shown to be a critical element in the P2 promoter of the c-myc gene .
We therefore believe that the MAZ transcription factor is also likely to play an important role in the control of developmental expression of the CD4 gene .
Activation of the TAL1 ( or SCL ) gene , originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation , is the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
The protein products of this gene contain the basic-helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers .
TAL1 expression by erythroid cells in vivo and in chemical-induced erythroleukemia cell lines in vivo suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation .
Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin ( Epo ) , we investigated whether the expression or activity of the TAL1 gene and its protein products were affected by Epo in splenic erythroblasts from mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus ( FVA cells ) .
Epo elicited a rapid , dose-related increase in TAL1 mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs .
An Epo-inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein .
Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo-induced phosphorylation of nuclear TAL1 protein .
These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages .
We describe a method for relative quantification of specific mRNA using a nonradioactive assay based on DNA strand competition between identical sequences of biotin- and fluorescein-labeled amplicon ( probe ) and unlabeled amplicon ( target ) during hybridization .
As the target quantity increased , that of the double-labeled probe decreased in accordance with the mass action law .
This technique was successfully applied to evaluate differences in glucocorticoid receptor expression in U937 cells before and after the addition of potent differentiation inducers : 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) and a combination of all-trans retinoic acid ( RA ) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 ( VD ) .
We observed that TPA treatment was associated with an increase in specific binding of [3H]dexamethasone and up-regulation of GR mRNA while no enhanced GR expression was perceived with RA /VD treatment .
In contrast to the purely enhancer-dependent effect of cytokines such as TNF on the activity of the HIV regulatory region ( LTR ) , we observed that okadaic acid ( OKA ) activates HIV transcription through both the enhancer , responding to the factor NF-kappa B , and the promoter domain of the LTR .
The inducibility of HIV LTR-driven luciferase expression constructs in lymphoblastoid cells stimulated by OKA depended on both functional Sp1 binding elements and the ability of the TATA box to bind the protein TBP .
In both transformed and normal lymphocytes , OKA stimulation induced intense phosphorylation of the constitutively expressed Sp1 protein in the nucleus , a property of OKA not shared by TNF , phorbol ester , or PHA and interleukin 2 .
Responsiveness of LTR constructs deleted of kappa B elements to HIV Tat expression was increased upon OKA but not TNF stimulation .
Our results suggest that SP1 phosphorylation induced by OKA , a selective inhibitor of the serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A , facilitates the formation of a transcription complex involving general transcription factors , HIV Tat , and Sp1 proteins .
The formation of this complex would increase , independently of an in synergy with NF-kappa B , the low basal activity of the HIV LTR observed in normal T lymphocytes .
To understand the molecular bases for cytokine redundancy and pleiotropy , we have compared the Stat proteins activated in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) by cytokines with shared and distinct actions .
Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) rapidly activated Stat5 in fresh PBL , and Stat3 and Stat5 in preactivated PBL .
IL-7 and IL-15 induced the same complexes as IL-2 , a feature explained by the existence of similar tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R beta and IL-7R that can serve as docking sites for Stat proteins .
IL-13 Induced the same complexes as IL-4 , a finding explained by our studies implicating IL-4R as a shared component of the receptors .
These studies demonstrate that a single cytokine can activate different combinations of Stat proteins under different physiological conditions , and also indicate two mechanisms by which distinct cytokines can activate the same Stat protein .
I kappa B-alpha inhibits transcription factor NF-kappa B by retaining it in the cytoplasm .
Various stimuli , typically those associated with stress or pathogens , rapidly inactivate I kappa B-alpha .
This liberates NF-kappa B to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of genes important for the defense of the organism .
Activation of NF-kappa B correlates with phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha and requires the proteolysis of this inhibitor .
When either serine-32 or serine-36 of I kappa B-alpha was mutated , the protein did not undergo signal-induced phosphorylation or degradation , and NF-kappa B could not be activated .
These results suggest that phosphorylation at one or both of these residues is critical for activation of NF-kappa B .
Erythropoietin ( Epo ) , the primary regulator of the production of erythroid cells , acts by binding to a cell surface receptor ( EpoR ) on erythroid progenitors .
We used deletion analysis and transfection assays with reporter gene constructs to examine the transcription control elements in the 5' flanking region of the human EpoR gene .
In erythroid cells most of the transcription activity was contained in a 150 bp promoter fragment with binding sites for transcription factors AP2 , Sp1 and the erythroid-specific GATA-1 .
The 150 bp hEpoR promoter exhibited high and low activity in erythroid OCIM1 and K562 cells , respectively , reflecting the high and low levels of constitutive hEpoR expression .
The GATA-1 and Sp1 binding sites in this promoter lacking a TATA sequence were necessary for a high level of transcription activation .
Protein-DNA binding studies suggested that Sp1 and two other CCGCCC binding proteins from erythroid and non-erythroid cells could bind to the Sp1 binding motif .
By increasing GATA-1 levels via co-transfection , we were able to transactivate the hEpoR promoter in K562 cells and non-erythroid cells , but not in the highly active OCIM1 cells , although GATA-1 mRNA levels were comparable in OCIM1 and K562 .
Interestingly , when we mutated the Sp1 site , resulting in a marked decrease in hEpoR promoter activity , we could restore transactivation by increasing GATA-1 levels in OCIM1 cells .
These data suggest that while GATA-1 can transactivate the EpoR promoter , the level of hEpoR gene expression does not depend on GATA-1 alone .
Rather , hEpoR transcription activity depends on coordination between Sp1 and GATA-1 with other cell-specific factors , including possibly other Sp1-like binding proteins , to provide high level , tissue-specific expression .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia evolves in two clinically distinct stages : a chronic and a blast crisis phase .
The molecular changes associated with chronic phase to blast crisis transition are largely unknown .
We have identified a cDNA clone , DR-nm23 , differentially expressed in a blast-crisis cDNA library , which has approximately 70 % sequence similarity to the putative metastatic suppressor genes , nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 .
The deduced amino acid sequence similarity to the proteins encoded by these two latter genes is approximately 65 % and includes domains and amino acid residues ( the leucine zipper-like and the RGD domain , a serine and a histidine residue in the NH2- and in the COOH-terminal portion of the protein , respectively ) postulated to be important for nm23 function .
DR-nm23 mRNA is preferentially expressed at early stages of myeloid differentiation of highly purified CD34+ cells .
Its constitutive expression in the myeloid precursor 32Dc13 cell line , which is growth-factor dependent for both proliferation and differentiation , results in inhibition of granulocytic differentiation induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and causes apoptotic cell death .
These results are consistent with a role for DR-nm23 in normal hematopoiesis and raise the possibility that its overexpression contributes to differentiation arrest , a feature of blastic transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia .
Expression of the IgG Fc receptor type I ( Fc gamma RI ) on myeloid cells is dramatically increased by treatment with interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .
We observed that Fc gamma RI transcript levels in monoblast-like U937 cells were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to IFN-gamma .
Treatment of U937 with IFN-gamma for 9 hr in the presence of cycloheximide led to super-induction of Fc gamma RI expression .
Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the rate of Fc gamma RI transcription was increased by IFN-gamma .
Genomic sequence upstream of the Fc gamma RIC gene was cloned and subjected to primer extension analysis , which demonstrated a single transcription initiation site without a TATA box .
Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20-bp region surrounding the transcription start site ( -7 to +13 ) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN-gamma responsive element ( GIRE ) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site .
A 17-bp sequence between positions -51 and -35 conferred IFN-gamma responsiveness on a heterologous promoter .
Double-stranded GIRE sequence , but not a scrambled sequence , was specifically bound by nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma treated U937 cells .
Gel shift experiments further showed that the STAT1 alpha protein bound to the Fc gamma RIC GIRE in response to IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells .
The Fc gamma RIC GIRE is homologous to the IFN-gamma activation sequence ( GAS ) of the guanylate binding protein and to X box elements of class II MHC genes .
Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the Fc gamma RIC gene by IFN-gamma involves the binding of STAT1 alpha to a 17-bp GAS homology in the proximal promoter .
Human T cell lymphotropic virus I ( HTLV-I ) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis ( also termed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy ) .
HTLV-I-infected peripheral blood T cells exhibit an initial phase of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) -dependent growth ; over time , by an unknown mechanism , the cells become IL-2-independent .
Whereas the Jak kinases Jak1 and Jak3 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins Stat3 and Stat5 are activated in normal T cells in response to IL-2 , this signaling pathway was constitutively activated in HTLV-I-transformed cells .
In HTLV-I-infected cord blood lymphocytes , the transition from IL-2-dependent to IL-2-independent growth correlated with the acquisition of a constitutively activated Jak-STAT pathway , which suggests that this pathway participates in HTLV-I-mediated T cell transformation .
To test the hypothesis that nitric oxide ( NO ) limits endothelial activation , we treated cytokine-stimulated human saphenous vein endothelial cells with several NO donors and assessed their effects on the inducible expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) .
In a concentration-dependent manner , NO inhibited interleukin ( IL ) -1 alpha-stimulated VCAM-1 expression by 35-55 % as determined by cell surface enzyme immunoassays and flow cytometry .
This inhibition was paralleled by reduced monocyte adhesion to endothelial monolayers in nonstatic assays , was unaffected by cGMP analogues , and was quantitatively similar after stimulation by either IL-1 alpha , IL-1 beta , IL-4 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF alpha ) , or bacterial lipopolysaccharide .
NO also decreased the endothelial expression of other leukocyte adhesion molecules ( E-selectin and to a lesser extent , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ) and secretable cytokines ( IL-6 and IL-8 ) .
Inhibition of endogenous NO production by L-N-monomethyl-arginine also induced the expression of VCAM-1 , but did not augment cytokine-induced VCAM-1 expression .
Nuclear run-on assays , transfection studies using various VCAM-1 promoter reporter gene constructs , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that NO represses VCAM-1 gene transcription , in part , by inhibiting NF-kappa B .
We propose that NO 's ability to limit endothelial activation and inhibit monocyte adhesion may contribute to some of its antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory properties within the vessel wall .
Murine macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1 alpha ) and its human equivalent ( GOS19 , LD78 , or AT464 ) are members of the -C-C family of low-molecular-weight chemokines .
Secreted from activated T cells and macrophages , bone marrow-derived MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 inhibits primitive hematopoietic stem cells and appears to be involved in the homeostatic control of stem cell proliferation .
It also induces chemotaxis and inflammatory responses in mature cell types .
Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms which control the expression of MIP-1 alpha/GOS19 .
Previous work has shown that in Jurkat T cells , a set of widely expressed transcription factors ( the ICK-1 family ) affect the GOS19 promoter .
One member , ICK-1A , behaves as a strong negative regulator .
In this communication , we provide evidence that the pathway of induction in the macrophage cell line U937 is different from that in Jurkat cells .
Furthermore , we show that the ICK-1 binding site does not confer negative regulation in U937 cells .
We provide evidence for an additional binding site , the MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) site , which overlaps the ICK-1 site .
Interaction of nuclear extracts from various cell lines and tissue with the MNP site leads to the formation of fast-migrating protein-DNA complexes with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities .
A mutation of the MNP site which does not abrogate ICK-1 binding inactivates the GOS19.1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells .
We propose that the MNP protein ( s ) binding at the MNP site constitutes a novel transcription factor ( s ) expressed in hematopoietic cells .
Toremifene exerts multiple and varied effects on the gene expression of human peripheral mononuclear cells .
After short-term , in vitro exposure to therapeutical levels , distinct changes in P-glycoprotein , steroid receptors , p53 and Bcl-2 expression take place .
In view of the increasing use of antiestrogens in cancer therapy and prevention , there is obvious merit in long-term in vivo studies to be conducted .
We have shown that the interaction of interleukin ( IL ) -5 with the receptor activates Lyn tyrosine kinase within 1 min and Jak2 tyrosine kinase within 1-3 min .
IL-5 also stimulates GTP binding to p21ras .
The signal is subsequently propagated through the activation of Raf-1 , MEK , and MAP kinases as shown by their increased autophosphorylation in vitro and phosphorylation in situ .
Jak2 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate STAT nuclear proteins .
The activation of STAT nuclear factors was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a gamma activation site ( GAS ) probe .
We found that IL-5 induces two GAS-binding proteins in eosinophils , one of which is STAT1 .
We conclude that IL-5 induced signals are propagated through two distinct pathways : ( 1 ) Lyn --> Ras --> Raf-1 --> MEK --> MAP kinase and ( 2 ) Jak2 --> STAT1 .
The IE2 gene product of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is one of a few viral regulatory proteins expressed immediately upon infection of the host cell .
It is a potent transcriptional activator of many viral and cellular promoters .
We found that the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product ( Rb ) dramatically suppressed this IE2 transactivation of various promoters .
However , unlike another tumor suppressor protein , p53 , Rb did not have any significant effect on basal levels of transcription , suggesting that Rb specifically interacts with IE2 rather than other cellular factors involved in the general transcription machinery .
We found by protein-affinity chromatography that Rb in nuclear extracts or produced by in vitro translation directly bound to IE2 .
Our results suggest that Rb may regulate the life cycle of HCMV , which is endemic in the human population .
Furthermore , these data may provide new insights into the slow rate of HCMV DNA replication in cells and the possible involvement of HCMV in tumorigenesis .
Expression of nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase , which is homologous to the nm23 gene product in a variety of species , has been found to be inversely associated with metastatic potential .
However , the relationship remains controversial according to the tumor cell types and experimental system , with conflicting results from different research groups .
In order to determine whether NDP kinase expression serves as a marker for metastatic potential in human skin cancer , we assessed the levels of NDP kinase expression in 9 keratoacanthomas ( KAs ) , 26 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) , and 25 basal cell carcinomas ( BCCs ) using immunohistochemistry .
The expression of NDP kinase was intense in KA and SCC compared with BCC .
However , the difference of NDP kinase expression between KA and SCC was not statistically significant .
And there was no statistically significant difference in NDP kinase expression between SCC with metastasis and SCC without metastasis .
Our results contradict the hypothesis concerning the possible role of nm23 gene as a metastatic suppressor gene in human skin cancer .
The mechanism of overexpression in various tumor cell types and its biological significance in cutaneous carcinogenesis remain to be determined .
The major histocompatibility ( MHC ) class II genes encode cell surface proteins that bind antigenic peptide for presentation to T-cells .
The class II proteins are expressed constitutively on B-cells and EBV- transformed B-cells , and are inducible by IFN-gamma on a wide variety of cell types .
Retinoblastoma protein ( RB ) is a tumor suppressor and functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding and inactivating the transactivator E2F-I .
RB-defective tumor lines are non-inducible for MHC class II by IFN-gamma , or very weakly inducible , but transfection of 2 different lines with RB expression vectors re-establishes or substantially enhances class II inducibility .
Therefore , we examined the RB status of a series of B-cell mutants that are defective in class II expression , generated either in vitro or derived from Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome ( BLS ) patients .
Nuclear matrix-bound RB was detectable in all cases , indicating that loss of RB is not responsible for decreased class II expression in these lines .
A second E2F-I binding protein , most likely DP-I , was also apparently normal in both class II-positive and -negative B-cell lines .
We also examined the IFN-gamma induction of CIITA in RB-defective lines .
CIITA is a class II gene transactivator known to be defective in one form of BLS and to be required for the induction of MHC class II by IFN-gamma .
CIITA mRNA is normally inducible by IFN-gamma in class II non-inducible , RB-defective lines , and in one line , re-expression of RB has no effect on CIITA mRNA induction levels .
Thus , the block in MHC class II inducibility in RB-defective cells is not due to a block in CIITA inducibility .
Interleukin 12 ( IL-12 ) is an important immunoregulatory cytokine whose receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily .
We have recently demonstrated that stimulation of human T and natural killer cells with IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Janus family tyrosine kinase JAK2 and Tyk2 , implicating these kinases in the immediate biochemical response to IL-12 .
Recently , transcription factors known as STATs ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) have been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to a number of cytokines that bind hematopoietin receptors and activate JAK kinases .
In this report we demonstrate that IL-12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a recently identified STAT family member , STAT4 , and show that STAT4 expression is regulated by T-cell activation .
Furthermore , we show that IL-12 stimulates formation of a DNA-binding complex that recognizes a DNA sequence previously shown to bind STAT proteins and that this complex contains STAT4 .
These data , and the recent demonstration of JAK phosphorylation by IL-12 , identify a rapid signal-transduction pathway likely to mediate IL-12-induced gene expression .
OBJECTIVE : Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is of vital importance during critical illness .
We have studied the adaptive mechanisms which occur at the level of the glucocorticoid receptor in glucocorticoid target tissues in patients with sepsis or septic shock .
DESIGN : The effects of hypercortisolaemia , hyperthermia and cellular composition on number of glucocorticoid receptors per cell and their affinity were evaluated , both in vitro and in vivo , in peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes of control subjects and in patients with sepsis or septic shock .
SUBJECTS : Fifteen patients ( age 25-79 ) with sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to an intensive care unit were studied .
The control group consisted of 24 healthy laboratory employees .
MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the glucocorticoid receptors were measured and compared to clinical data and the plasma cortisol concentrations .
RESULTS : Hypercortisolaemia , in vitro , resulted in a decreased affinity and a decreased binding capacity of the glucocorticoid receptor .
In vitro , hyperthermia as well as variations in the cellular composition did not influence the glucocorticoid receptor .
In vivo , there was no change in the number of receptors per cell in patients with sepsis or septic shock as compared to healthy controls .
However , a decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor was observed .
There was a weak but significant negative correlation between body temperature and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in the patient group .
There was no relation between circulating cortisol concentrations and glucocorticoid receptor affinity and number .
CONCLUSIONS : There is no obvious regulation of the number of glucocorticoid receptors by plasma cortisol concentrations in vivo .
The decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor together with the negative correlation between hyperthermia and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in patients with sepsis or septic shock suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation during critical illness is accompanied by peripheral adaptation in glucocorticoid receptor number and affinity .
Activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is an important aspect of signal transduction mediated by integrins .
In the human monocytic cell line THP-1 , either integrin-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin or ligation of beta 1 integrins with antibodies causes a rapid and intense tyrosine phosphorylation of two sets of proteins of about 65-75 and 120-125 kDa .
In addition , integrin ligation leads to nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kappa B transcription factor , to activation of a reporter gene driven by a promoter containing NF-kappa B sites , and to increased levels of mRNAs for immediate-early genes , including the cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta .
The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A block both integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and increases in IL-1 beta message levels , indicating a causal relationship between the two events .
The components tyrosine phosphorylated subsequent to cell adhesion include paxillin , pp125FAK , and the SH2 domain containing tyrosine kinase Syk .
In contrast , integrin ligation with antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk but not of FAK or paxillin .
In adhering cells , pre-treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but not of Syk , while IL-1 beta message induction is unaffected .
These observations indicate that the Syk tyrosine kinase may be an important component of an integrin signaling pathway in monocytic cells , leading to activation of NF-kappa B and to increased levels of cytokine messages .
To determine if New World primates express an inhibitor that influences glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding characteristics , we examined [3H]dexamethasone binding in cytosol prepared from B95-8 lymphoid cells , derived from the cotton top tamarin ( Saguinus oedipus ) , in combination with cytosol prepared from human or rat tissues .
B95-8 cytosol inhibited specific binding of [3H]dexamethasone ( P < 0.01 ) when mixed with cytosol prepared from either a human lymphoid cell line ( HL ) or rat thymus .
The inhibitory activity was heat labile and trypsin sensitive .
Peak inhibitory activity was found in the 150-200 kd fractions after Sephacryl G-200 ultrafiltration .
Scatchard analysis of [3H]dexamethasone binding using mixed cytosol showed a diminished GR apparent binding affinity when compared to HL cytosol .
Kinetic studies using mixed cytosol indicated that B95-8 cytosol did not affect the apparent dissociation rate of [3H]dexamethasone .
These data demonstrate that B95-8 cells contain a competitive inhibitor that prevents binding of dexamethasone to its cognate receptor .
The mRNA for the Duffy blood group antigen , the erythrocyte receptor for the Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite , has recently been cloned and shown to encode a widely expressed chemokine receptor .
Here , we show that the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene ( DARC ) is composed of a single exon and that most Duffy-negative blacks carry a silent FY*B allele with a single T to C substitution at nucleotide -46 .
This mutation impairs the promoter activity in erythroid cells by disrupting a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor .
With the recent characterization of the FY*A and FY*B alleles , these findings provide the molecular basis of the Duffy blood group system and an explanation for the erythroid-specific repression of the DARC gene in Duffy-negative individuals .
The present studies have examined the effects of pokeweed mitogen ( PWM ) on the induction of early growth response-1 gene ( EGR-1 ) in normal human B cells .
PWM regulates EGR-1 gene expression by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms .
Transient transfection assays with EGR-1 promoter fragments linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene demonstrated that PWM induced EGR-1 transcription is conferred by the CArG motif ( C C[AT]6GG ) in the EGR-1 promoter .
The results further demonstrated the activation of S6 kinase ( pp90rsk ) , evidenced by phosphorylation of S6 and serum response factor ( SRF ) peptides , in PWM treated B cells .
Taken together , these findings suggest that PWM is able to initiate an intracytoplasmic signalling cascade and EGR-1 induction in normal human B cells .
We have recently found a novel conserved motif in the promoters of several T-cell-expressed cytokines [ human interleukin-2 , -4 , -5 and -13 and human and mouse granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) ] .
It contains a core sequence CTTGG ... CCAAG which is present as part of larger palindromic sequences in each gene .
This suggest that they may interact with a new family of trans-acting factors .
In transfection assays , the human GM-CSF element has a strong positive effect on the expression of a reporter gene by the human T cell line Jurkat J6 upon stimulation .
In DNA mobility shift assays , this sequence can give either six different specific bands which are competed out by different parts of the sequence or one specific band which is competed out by each of the inverted repeats , depending on the reconstitution conditions .
In different genes , the core sequences are separated by integer numbers of helical turns .
Considering the strong positive regulatory effect of this element and its presence in several T-cell-expressed cytokine genes , it may be crucial to the coordinated expression of these cytokines in T helper cells .
A human T lymphoid cell line , PEER , dies by apoptosis in the presence of PMA and calcium ionophore .
A new gene , TINUR , was cloned from apoptotic PEER cells .
The expression of the TINUR gene is induced within 1 h after the cross-linking of the T cell Ag receptor complex .
TINUR belongs to the NGFI-B/nur77 family of the steroid receptor superfamily and is an orphan receptor .
TINUR binds to the same DNA sequence as NGFI-B/nur77 .
We also propose that the NGFI-B/nur77 family can be classified into two subtypes .
BACKGROUND : The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) and E-selectin by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) .
Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit NF-kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor I kappa B , we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate ( aspirin ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .
METHODS AND RESULTS : Gel-shift analyses demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-induced NF-kappa B mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol/L .
Induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression by TNF was dose-dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range , while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) was hardly affected .
Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM-1 transcription , since it dose-dependently inhibited induction of VCAM-1 mRNA by TNF .
As a functional consequence , adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF-stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin upregulation .
These effects of aspirin were not related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity , since indomethacin was ineffective .
CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits NF-kappa B mobilization , induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin , and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF , thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin .
Activation of NF-kappa B by various cellular stimuli involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor , I kappa B alpha , although the underlying mechanism remains unclear .
In the present study , the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in the regulation of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation was investigated .
Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations ( approximately 1-5 nM ) of calyculin A or okadaic acid , potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP-1 ) and type 2A ( PP-2A ) , induces the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha even in the absence of any cellular stimulus .
This action of the phosphatase inhibitors , which is associated with the activation of the RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer , is not affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) .
Furthermore , the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A-treated cells , but not that from TNF-alpha-stimulated cells , is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro , suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF-kappa B inducers .
However , induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF-alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha .
We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor .
Together , these results suggest that phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha , mediated through both the TNF-alpha-inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases , may serve to target I kappa B alpha for proteasome-mediated degradation .
The 5' flanking region of the human alpha-globin gene is highly G+C rich and contains multiple copies of the consensus sequence for the Sp1 binding site .
We investigated the role of this G+C-rich region in augmenting alpha-globin promoter activity in the presence of the far-upstream alpha-globin enhancer , HS-40 .
We show that in transiently transfected erythroid cells , deletion of the alpha-globin G+C-rich 5' flanking region has no effect on alpha-globin promoter activity .
However , upon stable integration into chromatin , deletion of this region causes a nearly 90 % decrease in promoter activity compared with expression from an alpha-globin promoter retaining this region .
These results suggest that the alpha-globin G+C-rich 5' flanking region augments alpha-globin promoter activity in a chromatin-dependent manner .
We further show that this G+C-rich region is required for the activation of alpha-globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .
Finally , we show by both footprint analysis and functional assays that the ability of the G+C-rich region to increase alpha-globin promoter activity from a stably integrated alpha-globin gene is mediated by its multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 .
We have earlier shown that stimulation of human CD4+ T cells with SEA presented on Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) -DR transfectants coexpressing either B7 or LFA-3 resulted in distinct cytokine profiles .
We now demonstrate that B7 , but not LFA-3 , strongly costimulated IL-2 transcription and mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells .
Maximal increase in IL-2 transcription was recorded with CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3 , suggesting a cooperative effect of B7 and LFA-3 at the transcriptional level .
Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that stimulation of CD4+ T cells with CHO-DR and staphylococcal enterotoxin A was sufficient to induce significant amounts of NF-kappa B binding proteins , whereas induction of AP-1 binding proteins required costimulation .
LFA-3 induced moderate levels of AP-1 , but did not influence the levels of NF-kappa B , while B7 costimulation strongly induced both AP-1 and substantially enhanced NF-kappa B binding proteins .
The CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3triple transfectant induced a further increase in AP-1 and NF-kappa B binding proteins compared with the double transfectants .
The level of Oct-1 binding proteins remained similar in all samples .
Super-shift analysis revealed that the NF-kappa B complex of costimulated CD4+ T cells contained large amounts of p50 , substantial amounts of p65 , and marginal levels of c-Rel proteins .
The AP-1 binding proteins contained c-Jun , Jun-D , and Fra-1 , but marginal amounts of Jun-B and c-Fos .
Our results indicate distinct effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on the activity of AP-1 and NF-kappa B .
These may partly account for the differential effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on IL-2 expression .
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) inhibits murine and human B lymphocyte immunoglobulin production through an unknown mechanism .
This study investigated the effect of TCDD on expression of the CD19 gene in a human B lymphocyte cell line .
Northern blot analysis showed that TCDD treatment decreased steady state levels of CD19 mRNA by 67 % in the IM-9 cell line .
Using a gel mobility shift assay , we identified a DNA-binding complex in IM-9 nuclear extracts that by several criteria appears to be the Ah receptor .
In addition , the Ah receptor complex recognized a DNA binding site for B cell lineage-specific activator protein ( BSAP ) in the promoter region of the human CD19 gene which is similar to the consensus Ah receptor DNA binding site .
These results suggest that the AhR could interfere with BSAP-stimulated CD19 gene transcription by competition for a common DNA binding site .
We recently identified a differentiation inhibitory factor ( I-factor ) in mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells as a murine homolog of the human nm23-H2 gene product .
nm23 genes encode proteins that participate in tumor metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes , although their mechanisms of action are still unknown .
Although all nm23 proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase activity , it has not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various functions of nm23 proteins .
In the present experiment , we examined the effect of nm23 proteins on various differentiation induction systems of human leukemic cells including HL-60 , U937 , HEL/S , KU812F , K562 , and HEL cells .
Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein inhibited the induction of erythroid differentiation of HEL , KU812 and K562 cells , but not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 , U937 and HEL/S cells .
The erythroid differentiation of HEL cells was inhibited by recombinant human nm23-H1 , -H2 , mouse nm23-M1 , and -M2 proteins .
Moreover , both the mutant nm23-H2His protein and truncated nm23-H2 protein containing N-terminal ( 1-60 ) peptide , which do not have NDP kinase activity , also inhibited erythroid differentiation of HEL cells .
These results suggest that ( 1 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of I-factor/nm23 protein is not restricted to monocytic differentiation of M1 cells , ( 2 ) the inhibitory activity is exhibited without species specificity , and ( 3 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of the nm23/NDP kinase protein is independent of its enzyme activity and requires the presence of N-terminal peptides .
Endothelial cells stimulated by LPS express E-selectin , which plays an important role in mediating neutrophil adhesion during inflammation .
E-selectin is induced within 1-2 h , peaks at 4-6 h , and gradually returns to basal level by 24 h .
rBPI21 , a recombinant N-terminal fragment of human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein ( BPI ) , inhibited LPS-induced E-selectin expression when added at the same time as , and up to 6 h after , LPS .
Delayed administration of rBPI21 also affected LPS-mediated activation of the nuclear factor , NF-kappa B .
Two to 4 h following LPS addition to endothelial cells , when NF-kappa B was already activated , addition of rBPI21 resulted in marked reduction of NF-kappa B detectable at 4 or 6 h .
These results indicate that endothelial activation requires continuous presence of LPS , and rBPI21 acts to reverse LPS-mediated endothelial activation by interrupting the on-going LPS signal .
Antigen complexed with major histocompatibility complex class I or II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells interacts with the T cell receptor ( TCR ) on the surface of T cells and initiates an activation cascade .
So called costimulatory signals , mediated by other cell surface interactions or soluble cytokines produced by antigen presenting cells , are also required for complete T cell activation .
High levels of cytokine gene expression in T cells also required both TCR and costimulatory signals .
The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor requires sequences in the promoter as well as a powerful enhancer located 3kb upstream to respond to TCR-like signals .
These promoter and enhancer regions are mainly activated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .
The activation of NFAT by TCR signals has been well described for interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) and IL-4 gene transcription in T cells .
Costimulatory signals , such as activation of the CD28 cell surface molecule on T cells , lead to activation through a distinct region of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) promoter .
This region is termed the CK-1 or CD28RE and appears to bind specific members of the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors .
Human T leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infects T cells and can lead to increase GM-CSF expression .
We have found that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein , tax , acts as a costimulatory signal for GM-CSF and IL-2 gene transcription , in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression .
Tax activates the GM-CSF promoter through the CK-1/CD28RE region and also activates nuclear factor-kappa B binding to this region .
However , other transcription factors or coactivators of NF-kappa B are required for tax activation but these remain to be identified .
The CK-1/CD28RE of GM-CSF shows a high degree of similarity to the IL-2 CD28RE and the IL-3 gene also contains a related region .
This observation , together with the fact that both GM-CSF and IL-2 respond to TCR signals via NFAT , implies a high degree of conservation in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in T cells .
1. Administration of danazol for over one month reduced the levels of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and its mRNA to approximately 50 and 20 % , respectively in monocytes .
2. Danazol did not alter the degradation rate of ER mRNA in monocytes .
3. Danazol decreased the transcription rate of ER gene to approximately 50 % in monocytes in a run-on assay .
4. Danazol may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for ER gene , which leads to the reduction of ER mRNA and ER expressions in monocytes .
IL-2-mediated T cell proliferation is a critical early event in the inflammatory process .
Formation of the NFAT-1 transcriptional complex on the IL-2 promoter is essential for IL-2 transcription .
Using a cell line that is stably transfected with a trimer of the NFAT-1 regulatory element linked to a lac-Z reporter gene , we screened for inhibitors of NFAT-1-mediated beta-galactosidase activity .
WIN 61058 and WIN 53071 were identified as microM inhibitors .
These compounds also inhibited beta-galactosidase mRNA levels .
Similar inhibition of NFAT-1-mediated gene expression was observed in a second cell line , which is stably transfected with NFAT-1 regulatory elements linked to the reporter gene for sCD8 .
At 10 microM , both compounds inhibited IL-2 mRNA and protein levels in the NFAT-1-linked lac-Z transfectants , and in human lymphocytes .
Both compounds inhibited the mixed lymphocyte reaction , and this inhibition was reversed by exogenous IL-2 .
WIN 53071 inhibited IL-2 production induced in the calcium-dependent PMA and ionomycin pathway .
Conversely , calcium-independent anti-CD28 Ab and PMA-induced IL-2 production was resistant .
Both compounds altered the NFAT-1 transcriptional complex , causing its retarded mobility on gels .
By these functional criteria , we believe we have identified two structurally distinct , novel inhibitors of NFAT-1-mediated transcription .
Monocyte-macrophage differentiation was used as a model system for studying gene regulation of the human vacuolar H(+)-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) .
We examined mRNA levels of various V-ATPase subunits during differentiation of both native monocytes and the cell line THP-1 , and found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms could account for increases in cell V-ATPase content .
From nuclear runoff experiments , we found that one subunit in particular , the B2 isoform ( Mr = 56,000 ) , was amplified primarily by transcriptional means .
We have begun to examine the structure of the B2 subunit promoter region .
Isolation and sequencing of the first exon and 5'-flanking region of this gene reveal a TATA-less promoter with a high G + C content .
Primer extension and ribonuclease protection analyses indicate a single major transcriptional start site .
We transfected promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids into THP-1 cells to define sequences that mediate transcriptional control during monocyte differentiation .
We found that sequences downstream from the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer increased expression during THP-1 differentiation .
DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis revealed the existence of multiple AP2 and Sp1 binding sites in the 5'-untranslated and proximal coding regions .
Expression of the protooncogene c-fos is controlled by three main regulatory pathways involving kinase C , cAMP , and calcium .
Kinase C mediates its effects via phosphorylation of serum response factor ( SRF ) which interacts with the serum response element ( SRE ) ; cAMP and calcium mediate their effects via phosphorylation of CREB ( cAMP regulatory element binding protein ) presumably by activation of a protein kinase A or calmodulin-regulated kinase .
We have examined the function of these elements in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells ( Ramos and Daudi ) as well as a T lymphocytic cell line ( Jurkat ) .
We have found that stimulation of any one of these pathways alone has little or no effect on c-fos induction .
However , kinase C activation ( PMA stimulation ) combined with either cAMP ( forskolin plus MIX ) or calcium stimulation ( ionophore ) leads to greatly enhanced c-fos induction .
By contrast , cAMP in the presence of calcium shows no synergy in c-fos induction .
Okadaic acid augments PMA- as well as calcium-mediated activation of c-fos , and has little or no effect when combined with cAMP .
The main difference between Ramos ( B cells ) and Jurkat ( T cells ) in the regulation of c-fos is that cAMP plus calcium is strongly synergistic in Jurkat and is without effect in Ramos .
Analysis of AP-1 activity using gel mobility shift assays confirms that the requirements for synergy in c-fos mRNA induction are paralleled by requirements for synergy in induction of AP-1 activity .
Signaling in B cells due to anti-Ig stimulation involves both kinase C activation and release of intracellular calcium , and results in c-fos mRNA induction .
Our results indicate that synergy between the kinase C activation and calcium is needed for efficient c-fos induction since neither of these two alone induces c-fos well .
That synergy of signaling pathways is relevant for the anti-Ig induction of c-fos is supported by the fact that cAMP-inducing agents and okadaic acid further enhance anti-Ig induction of c-fos .
These results suggest that cell-specific patterns of synergy are an essential feature for c-fos induction and may be relevant for c-fos control through B and T cell antigen receptors .
The human granulocyte-macrophage CSF ( GM-CSF ) gene is expressed in T cells in response to TCR activation that can be mimicked by treatment of the cells with PMA and Ca2+ ionophore .
The gene contains a proximal functional promoter region ( -620 to +34 ) , as well as a powerful enhancer located 3 kb upstream , both of which are involved in the response of the gene to TCR activation .
The proximal promoter contains a region termed CLEO ( -54 to -31 ) that consists of a purine-rich element abutting an activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) -like site , as well as an upstream nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) site ( -85 to -76 ) and a CK-1 element ( -101 to -92 ) .
We show in this work that mutations in either the purine-rich region of the CLEO element or the NF-kappa B site result in reduced PMA/Ca2+ activation of a 620-bp human GM-CSF promoter- luciferase reporter construct in Jurkat T cells by 65 % and 50 % , respectively .
The major inducible protein complex that binds to the human CLEO ( hCLEO ) element is an AP-1-like complex that is inducible by PMA alone , but shows increased binding in response to PMA together with Ca2+ ionophore .
Although the binding of this complex is not cyclosporin-sensitive , promoter induction is inhibited by cyclosporin treatment .
A second weak inducible complex resembling nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) was also observed binding to the hCLEO region .
By using recombinant proteins , we confirmed that AP-1 , NF-ATp , and a higher order NF-ATp /AP-1 complex could all form with the hCLEO element , and we have also defined the sequence requirements for binding of each of these complexes .
We found that expression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin could substitute for Ca2+ ionophore and synergize with PMA to activate the GM-CSF promoter , and conversely that mutant-activated Ras could substitute for PMA and cooperate with Ca2+ ionophore .
Co-expression of Ras and calcineurin , however , did not activate the GM-CSF promoter , but required the additional expression of NF-kappa B p65 .
These results imply that at least three signals are required to activate the GM-CSF proximal promoter , and that the signals impinge on distinct transcription factors that bind to the hCLEO and NF-kappa B regions of the promoter .
IL-10 affects monocytes and T cells by driving the progression of immune responsiveness such that Th2 lymphocyte-mediated effects predominate .
In this report , we show that in monocytes and T cells IL-10 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription , STAT1 alpha and STAT3 , in a differential manner such that the relative formation of homo- and heterodimers varies between the two cell types .
Moreover , monocytes express a novel IL-10-stimulated STAT protein with an M(r) of 70 kDa that is recognized by the anti-STAT3 Ab but is not observed in T cells .
IL-10 treatment of both T cells and monocytes results in the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 and Jak1 , but not Jak2 or Jak3 .
Selective modulation of immune responsiveness by IL-10 in cells such as monocytes and T cells may result in part from the differential activation of STAT protein pairs .
Biological markers of ovulation , after a great in the past , have been fallen into disuse for the large diffusion of biochemical and biophysical ones .
However , the real effect of hormones involved in ovulation is expressed by biological modifications on target tissues .
To explore the modifications of not reproductive target tissues as ovulation markers we studied the behaviour of Albuminemia , Platelet Factor IV ( as indicator of Platelet Aggregation ) , Type II estrogenic receptors in 42 ovulation induced women , undergoing our observation .
33 of them had ovulation and 9 developed a LUF syndrome , constituting two biological models of an opposite situation for the three markers observed .
All the markers considered were sufficiently sensitive , but among them , Platelet Factor IV was the most reliable to the hormonal ovulatory situation .
The inert quality of MRL-Ipr/Ipr ( Ipr ) peripheral CD4-CD8- ( CD4-8- ) T cells manifests primarily as an inability to proliferate or produce IL-2 in response to TCR or mitogenic stimulation .
Yet these same cells do initiate early TCR-mediated signaling events , such as generation of inositol phosphates and increased intracellular calcium .
They also display constitutively high levels of p59fyn and CD3 zeta tyrosine phosphorylation .
The generation of second messengers in T cells normally leads to downstream signaling that results in transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene .
We , therefore , compared the activation state of the IL-2 gene promoter region in freshly isolated and stimulated Ipr CD4-8-T cells with that of normal T lymphocytes .
Levels of the octamer , NF-kappa B ( p50-p65 heterodimer ) , and AP-1 transcriptional factors are constitutively elevated in freshly isolated Ipr CD4-8-T cells , consistent with the activated phenotype of these cells .
Upon stimulation with mitogens , formation of the transactivating complex , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) , occurs with normal kinetics in Ipr CD4-8-T cells .
Yet , the levels of the activating NF-AT complex never reach those observed in similarly stimulated normal T cells .
Furthermore , nuclear extracts from Ipr CD4-8-T cells display high levels of a novel specific binding activity at the NF-AT site , which is present at much lower levels in freshly isolated normal T lymphocytes .
Upon mitogenic stimulation , the binding activity of the novel NF-AT-binding factor is rapidly down-regulated in normal T cells , but persists at high levels in Ipr CD4-8-T cells .
These two abnormalities at the NF-AT site provide a potential mechanism to account for the defect in IL-2 production from Ipr CD4-8-T cells .
CD30 , a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , is expressed constitutively on the surface of the human T cell line ACH-2 , which is chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ( HIV ) -1 .
We demonstrate that cross-linking CD30 with an anti-CD30-specific monoclonal antibody , which mimics the described biological activities of the CD30 ligand ( CD30L ) , results in HIV expression .
CD30 cross-linking does not alter proliferation of ACH-2 cells and the induction of HIV expression is not mediated by endogenous TNF alpha/beta .
Furthermore , cross-linking of CD30 leads to NF-kappa B activation and enhanced HIV transcription .
Thus , CD30-CD30L interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a kappa B-dependent pathway that is independent of TNF .
This mechanism may be important in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected CD4+ T cells , especially in lymphoid organs where cell to cell contact is conducive to receptor-ligand interactions .
Type II major histocompatibility complex combined immune deficiency ( type II MHC CID or bare lymphocyte syndrome ) is a congenital immunodeficiency disease characterized by absent MHC class II expression .
Four distinct complementation groups have been identified .
Recently , the defective gene in group II type II MHC CID has been isolated and termed CIITA .
Here , we demonstrate that CIITA is an MHC class II gene-specific transcription activator .
The transcription activation function is provided by the N-terminal acidic domain ( amino acids 26-137 ) , which is experimentally exchangeable with a heterologous viral transcription-activating domain .
The specificity of CIITA for three major MHC class II genes , DR , DQ and DP , is mediated by its remaining C-terminal residues ( amino acids 317-1130 ) .
The transactivation of multiple cis elements , especially S and X2 , of the DR alpha proximal promoter in group II CID cells is CIITA dependent .
Since CIITA overexpression in normal cells did not increase class II expression , we propose that initiation of CIITA expression serves as the on-off switch , while availability of downstream interactor ( s ) limits transcription .
Adhesion molecules that tether circulating leukocytes to endothelial cells may also transduce or modulate outside-in signals for cellular activation , providing an initial regulatory point in the inflammatory response .
Adhesion of human monocytes to P-selectin , the most rapidly expressed endothelial tethering factor , increased the secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) by the leukocytes when they were stimulated with platelet-activating factor .
Increased cytokine secretion was specifically inhibited by G1 , an anti-P-selectin mAb that prevents P-selectin from binding to its ligand ( P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 ) on myeloid cells .
Moreover , tethering by P-selectin specifically enhanced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) , a transcription factor required for expression of MCP-1 , TNF-alpha , and other immediate-early genes .
These results demonstrate that P-selectin , through its ligands on monocytes , may locally regulate cytokine secretion in inflamed tissues .
Transcriptional regulation of the human alpha-like globin genes , embryonic zeta 2 and adult alpha , during erythroid development is mediated by a distal enhancer , HS-40 .
Previous protein-DNA binding studies have shown that HS-40 consists of multiple nuclear factor binding motifs that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific manner .
We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these factor binding motifs of HS-40 by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in erythroid cell cultures .
Three of these HS-40 enhancer motifs , 5'NF-E2/AP1 , GT II , and GATA-1(c) , positively regulate the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in embryonic/fetal erythroid K562 cells and the adult alpha-globin promoter activity in adult erythroid MEL cells .
On the other hand , the 3'NF-E2/AP1 motif is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the zeta 2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells , and this dual function appears to be modulated through differential binding of the ubiquitous AP1 factors and the erythroid-enriched NF-E2 factor .
Mutation in the GATA-1(d) motif , which exhibits an adult erythroid-specific genomic footprint , decreases the HS-40 enhancer function in dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cells but not in K562 cells .
These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different HS-40 motifs .
The remarkable correlation between genomic footprinting data and the mutagenesis results also suggests that the erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific regulation of human alpha-like globin promoters is indeed modulated by stable binding of specific nuclear factors in vivo .
The protooncogene p21ras , a monomeric G protein family member , plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events .
Here , we report that nitric oxide ( NO ) activates p21ras in human T cells as evidenced by an increase in GTP-bound p21ras .
In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21ras demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible .
Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21ras in association with GDP/GTP exchange .
The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling , such as NF-kappa B activation , and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell .
These studies identify p21ras as a target of the same cell .
These studies identify p21ras as a target of NO in T cells and suggest that NO activates p21ras by an action which mimics that of guanine nucleotide exchange factors .
The regulation of interleukin ( IL ) -2 gene expression has been investigated mainly in T lymphocytes , the predominant producers of IL-2 .
However , B cells can also synthesize IL-2 .
In the present study we analyzed the control of IL-2 promoter activity in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -transformed B cell clones which are capable of secreting IL-2 at a low level after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin .
Transient transfections using reporter constructs with multiples of transcription factor binding sites from the IL-2 promoter [ distal nuclear factor ( NF ) -AT , proximal NF-AT , AP-1/Octamer ( UPS ) or NF-chi B ( TCEd ) sites ] were performed .
In EBV-transformed B clones , the chi B site exerted the strongest inducible activity ; the NF-AT binding sites showed either no or only weak activity compared to Jurkat T cells .
An IL-2 promoter bearing a defective NF-chi B site was completely inactive in EBV-transformed B cells , while it still had activity in Jurkat T cells .
In seven EBV-B cell clones or lines differing in their capacity to secrete IL-2 , the activity of the IL-2 promoter correlated well with the status of IL-2 secretion .
Similarly , a human immunodeficiency virus promoter , whose activity is controlled through chi B factors , was found to be active in the IL-2 producing EBV-B cells , but inactive in the non-IL-2-producing cells .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using protein extracts from EBV-B cells and the IL-2 NF-chi B probe revealed the constitutive generation of chi B complexes in IL-2-secreting cells consisting mainly of heterodimeric p50/p65 complexes .
A weaker chi B complex formation and faster-migrating complexes were detected in non-IL-2-secreting cells .
These results demonstrate that the IL-2 NF-chi B site is indispensable for the activity of the IL-2 promoter in EBV-transformed B cells , whereas other transcription factors appear to be less important for IL-2 expression in these cells .
The normal cell cycle is regulated by several molecules , such as the tumor-suppressor protein pRb , the G1 cyclins , the cyclin-dependent kinases , and their inhibitors .
These regulators are targeted by negative growth regulatory signals , such as that provided by TGF-beta .
Here , we show that the presence of either wild-type EBV or its transforming latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) results in the loss of TGF-beta 1-mediated growth inhibition in human B cells .
Chemical cross-linking with 125I-labeled TGF-beta 1 showed an essentially normal TGF-beta receptor profile in EBV-positive and EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines , and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals , as evidenced by the TGF-beta 1-mediated modulation of junB gene expression .
However , TGF-beta 1 did not induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV ( or LMP-1 ) -positive cells as opposed to EBV -negative cells , suggesting a dichotomy in the TGF-beta 1 signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses .
Furthermore , LMP-1 was found to induce the expression of cyclin D2 ; normal B cells or EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells do not express D-type cyclins .
Taken together , these data point to a potential mechanism underlying EBV-mediated B cell transformation whereby constitutive induction of key cell cycle regulators by LMP-1 can lead to pRb hyperphosphorylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation .
The effect of treatment on thyroid antibody production and T cell reactivity to thyroid antigens was studied in 15 patients with Graves ' disease ( GD ) before and after thyroidectomy , 19 patients with GD before and after radioactive iodine ( RAI ) therapy , and 9 patients maintained euthyroid on antithyroid drugs ( ATD ) .
Twenty subjects matched for age and sex without known thyroid disease served as controls .
In GD patients , the responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and TSH receptor ( TSHR ) -specific T cell lines to recombinant human TSHR extracellular domain , thyroglobulin , and TSHR peptides were examined on the day of surgery or RAI therapy ( day 0 ) and also 6-8 weeks and 3-6 months thereafter .
Reactivity to TSHR peptides before surgery was heterogeneous and spanned the entire extracellular domain .
Six to 8 weeks after subtotal thyroidectomy , the number of patients ' PBMC responding to any peptide and the average number of recognized peptides decreased .
A further decrease in the T cell reactivity to TSHR peptides was observed 3-6 months after surgery .
The responses of PBMC from Graves ' patients before RAI therapy were less than those in the presurgical group .
Six to 8 weeks after RAI therapy , the number of patients responding to any peptide and the average number of recognized peptides increased .
Three to 6 months after RAI , T cell responses to TSHR peptides were less than those 6-8 weeks after RAI therapy , but still higher than the values on day 0 .
Responses of PBMC from patients with GD , maintained euthyroid on ATD , were lower than those before surgery or RAI therapy .
The reactivity of T cell lines in different groups reflected a pattern similar to PBMC after treatment .
TSHR antibody and microsomal antibody levels decreased after surgery , but increased after RAI therapy .
The difference in the number of recognized peptides by patients ' PBMC before RAI and surgery may reflect the effect of long term therapy with ATD in the patients before RAI vs. the shorter period in patients before surgery .
The decreased T cell reactivity to thyroid antigens after thyroidectomy could be the result of removal of a major part of the thyroid gland or redistribution of suppressor-inducer T cells .
The increased T cell response after RAI therapy is probably epitope specific , rather than a response to the whole TSHR molecule .
Synchronous recognition of peptides 158-176 and 248-263 is important for the development of GD , and the loss of recognition of one of these epitopes may be an early sign of immune remission and a predictor of euthyroidism .
Molecular events that underlie the well-defined phenotypic changes of the differentiating thymocyte are poorly understood .
A candidate gene to control thymocyte differentiation , T cell factor-1 ( TCF-1 ) * encodes a DNA-binding protein .
Its mRNA expression pattern is complex during embryogenesis , yet restricted to lymphocytes postnatally .
Expression studies on TCF-1 protein have been hampered by the difficulty to raise antibodies due to extreme evolutionary conservation .
TCF-1 knock-out mice , generated recently in our laboratory , have strongly decreased numbers of thymocytes , but are otherwise normal .
We have used these mice to generate anti-TCF-1 antibodies .
By immunization with a recombinant fusion protein , we show that TCF-1 knock-out mice readily yield antiserum titers against human and mouse TCF-1 protein .
Wild-type littermates remain unresponsive to TCF-1 while they mount a high-titer antibody response to the fusion protein , Maltose Binding Protein ( MBP ) .
Subsequently , TCF-1-specific hybridomas could be prepared from the spleens of immunized knock-out mice .
This study illustrates the almost complete tolerance of mice for human TCF-1 and demonstrates that this tolerance is readily broken by gene knock-out .
Furthermore , the usefulness of knock-out mice for the generation of monoclonal antibodies against the gene product of interest is underscored .
We have identified an in vivo footprint over the PuF site on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
The PuF site on the silent normal c-myc allele was unoccupied .
We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody , UV cross-linking followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis , and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c-myc PuF site .
Transfection experiments with c-myc promoter constructs in both DHL-9 and Raji cells revealed that the PuF site functioned as a positive regulatory element in B cells with a drop in activity with mutation of this site .
Access to this site is blocked in the normal silent c-myc allele ; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells .
Interaction between the stage selector element ( SSE ) in the proximal gamma-globin promoter and hypersensitivity site 2 in the locus control region partly mediates the competitive silencing of the beta-globin promoter in the fetal developmental stage .
We have now demonstrated that a second SSE-like element in the 5'-untranslated region of the gamma-gene also contributes to this competitive silencing of the beta-gene .
Utilizing transient transfection assays in the fetal erythroid cell line , K562 , we have shown that the core enhancer of hypersensitivity site 2 can preferentially interact with the proximal gamma-promoter in the absence of the SSE , completely silencing a linked beta-promoter .
Mutation of a 20-base pair sequence of the gamma-gene 5'-untranslated region ( UTR ) led to derepression of beta-promoter activity .
A marked activation of gamma-promoter activity was also observed with this mutation , suggesting the presence of a repressor .
Fine mutagenesis dissected these activities to different regions of the 5'-UTR .
The stage selector activity was localized to a region centered on nucleotides +13 to +15 .
Electromobility shift assays utilizing this sequence demonstrated binding of a fetal and erythroid-specific protein .
The repressor activity of the 5'-UTR was localized to tandem GATA-like sites , which appear to bind a complex of two proteins , one of which is the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 .
These results indicate that the 5'-UTR of the gamma-gene contains sequences that may be important for its transcriptional and developmental regulation .
The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappa B plays a central role in the induced expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and in many aspects of the genetic program mediating normal T-cell activation and growth .
The nuclear activity of NF-kappa B is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an inhibitory subunit called I kappa B alpha .
This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of NF-kappa B-inducing agents , including T-cell mitogens , proinflammatory cytokines , and viral transactivators such as the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 .
To explore these I kappa B alpha-dependent mechanisms for NF-kappa B induction , we identified novel mutants of I kappa B alpha that uncouple its inhibitory and signal-transducing functions in human T lymphocytes .
Specifically , removal of the N-terminal 36 amino acids of I kappa B alpha failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm .
However , this deletion mutation prevented the induced phosphorylation , degradative loss , and functional release of I kappa B alpha from NF-kappa B in Tax-expressing cells .
Alanine substitutions introduced at two serine residues positioned within this N-terminal regulatory region of I kappa B alpha also yielded constitutive repressors that escaped from Tax-induced turnover and that potently inhibited immune activation pathways for NF-kappa B induction , including those initiated from antigen and cytokine receptors .
In contrast , introduction of a phosphoserine mimetic at these sites rectified this functional defect , a finding consistent with a causal linkage between the phosphorylation status and proteolytic stability of this cytoplasmic inhibitor .
Together , these in vivo studies define a critical signal response domain in I kappa B alpha that coordinately controls the biologic activities of I kappa B alpha and NF-kappa B in response to viral and immune stimuli .
Human prostatic epithelial cells from an androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line were examined in response to conditioned medium ( CM ) derived from phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) -stimulated lymphocytes .
Addition of CM caused a greater than 70 % reduction of cell proliferation by cell counting and cell cycle .
These cells showed G1 phase arrest and the clonogenicity was reduced .
The growth-modulating effect was dose-dependent and not due to cell lysis or apoptosis .
The binding of androgen to androgen receptor on these cells showed approximately 50 % reduction , underlining a proliferation reduction mechanism .
The prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) was downregulated to approximately 75 % during the process .
Cell morphology showed dendritic processes extending from cytoplasm and other neuroendocrine cell characteristics .
The expression of several cytoskeleton and intracellular proteins increased as determined by immunostaining on slides and by ELISA procedures .
These included vimentin , correlating to cell shape changes , cytokeratins 8 and 18 , associated with differentiated cell types of prostate epithelia , and neuron-specific enolase and serotonin , associated with neuroendocrine cells .
From these cellular changes , we can infer that the cell growth was modulated along with induction of terminal differentiation .
Activated T cells were demonstrated to be important in providing the modulating activity .
This growth modulator was semipurified and had an estimated molecular weight 13,000 to 24,000 Da .
The activity was determined to be distinct from TGF , TNF , and some commonly known lymphokines .
The interaction between lymphoid and prostatic cells in growth and development is described .
Human peripheral blood monocytes responded to stimulation of platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) with up-regulation of the transcript for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) , a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells .
This function of PAF was observed at nanomolar concentrations of the ligand , starting at 30 min after stimulation .
The PAF-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA was accompanied by an increase in kappa B binding activity .
These functions of PAF appeared to be mediated through the cell surface PAF receptors , as two PAF receptor antagonists , WEB 2086 and L-659 , 989 , blocked both the up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity induced by PAF .
The antagonists , however , had no effect on phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and kappa B binding activity .
Pretreatment of monocytes with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of PAF , whereas cholera toxin had no inhibitory effect .
Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor for NF-kappa B activation , markedly reduced PAF-stimulated kappa B binding activity as well as up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA .
These results suggest a potential role of PAF in HB-EGF expression and provide evidence that this stimulation may occur through increased kappa B binding activity .
We have previously described a mutant B lymphoblastoid cell line , Clone-13 , that expresses HLA-DQ in the absence of HLA-DR and -DP .
Several criteria indicated that the defect in this cell line influences the activity of an isotype-specific transcription factor .
Indeed , transient transfection of HLA-DRA and DQB reporter constructs indicated that the affected factor operates via cis-elements located between -141 base pairs and the transcription initiation site .
A series of hybrid DRA/DQB reporter constructs was generated to further map the relevant cis-elements in this system .
Insertion of oligonucleotides spanning the DQB X-box ( but not the DQB-W region or the DQB Y-box ) upstream of -141 in a DRA reporter plasmid rescued expression to nearly wild-type levels .
Substitution promoters were then generated where the entire X-box , or only the X1- or X2-boxes of HLA-DRA were replaced with the analogous regions of HLA-DQB .
The DQB X2-box was able to restore expression to the silent DRA reporter construct .
Moreover , replacement of the DQB X2-box with the DRA X2-box markedly diminished the activity of the DQB promoter in the mutant cell .
None of the hybrid reporter constructs were defective when transfected into the wild-type , HLA-DR/-DQ positive parental cell line , Jijoye .
These studies suggest that the divergent X2-box of the class II major histocompatibility complex promoters plays an important role in influencing differential expression of the human class II isotypes .
The ZEBRA protein has a unique biological function among herpesviral proteins .
It is responsible for the disruption of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latency and the induction of the lytic cycle .
ZEBRA is a bZIP transcriptional activator which binds as a dimer to 7-bp response elements within EBV promoters and is directly involved in the stimulation of virus replication at the EBV lytic origin .
We have employed the ZEBRA/EBV biological system to test whether a heterologous activation domain can substitute for another activation domain ( the ZEBRA domain ) .
The ZEBRA activation region was replaced with the potent acid activation region from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein or with the activation region of the EBV R protein .
Both chimeras were found to transactivate model and native promoters at equivalent or better levels than ZEBRA itself .
Activation was not target- or cell-type dependent , nor was it dependent on the presence of virus .
These activation domains restored ZEBRA 's ability to induce early antigen and to stimulate origin replication to levels that were equal to or greater than those of wild type .
These studies suggest that the specificities of some of the known biological functions of ZEBRA are not dependent upon the nature of the activation domain present within ZEBRA .
Germ line C transcripts can be induced by IL-4 in the human B cell line , BL-2 .
Utilizing a IFN-gamma activation site-like DNA sequence element located upstream of the I epsilon exon , we demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that IL-4 induced a binding activity in the cytosol and nucleus of BL-2 cells .
This factor was designated IL-4 NAF ( IL-4-induced nuclear-activating factors ) and was identified as a tyrosine phosphoprotein , which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus upon IL-4 treatment .
Because these are the characteristics of a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein , we determined whether antibodies to Stat proteins will interfere with gel mobility shift and found that antibodies to IL-4 Stat , also known as Stat6 , but not antibodies to other Stat proteins , interfere with the formation of the IL-4 NAF complex .
Congruous with the involvement of a Stat protein , IL-4 induced robust Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) activity in BL-2 cells .
Cotransfection of JAK3 with IL-4 Stat into COS-7 cells produced an intracellular activity which bound the same IFN-gamma activation site-like sequence and comigrated with IL-4 NAF in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
These results show that IL-4 NAF is IL-4 Stat , which is activated by JAK3 in response to IL-4 receptor engagement .
Almost 25 % of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) have tumor-specific rearrangements of the TAL1 gene .
Although TAL1 expression has not been observed in normal lymphocytes , TAL1 gene products are readily detected in leukemic cells that harbor a rearranged TAL1 allele .
Hence , it has been proposed that ectopic expression of TAL1 promotes the development of T-ALL .
In this report , we show that TAL1 is expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T-ALL , including many that do not display an apparent TAL1 gene alteration .
A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of TAL1 was used to determine the allele specificity of TAL1 transcription in primary T-ALL cells .
Monoallelic expression of TAL1 was observed in the leukemic cells of all patients ( 8 of 8 ) bearing a TAL1 gene rearrangement .
In the leukemic cells of patients without detectable TAL1 rearrangements , TAL1 transcription occurred in either a monoallelic ( 3 of 7 patients ) or a biallelic ( 4 of 7 patients ) fashion .
Thus , TAL1 activation in these patients may result from subtle alterations in cis-acting regulatory sequences ( affecting expression of a single TAL1 allele ) or changes in trans-acting factors that control TAL1 transcription ( affecting expression of both TAL1 alleles ) .
Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia ( M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down 's syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .
To clarify properties of the blast cells in M7 and TMD cases , we examined erythroid markers expression in blasts from six cases with M7 and seven cases with TMD in this study .
Erythroid-specific mRNAs encoding gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase were found to be expressed in blasts from most of these cases , indicating that majorities of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes .
We also found that mRNAs encoding GATA-1 and GATA-2 are expressed in all these cases .
These results suggest that M7 blasts and TMD blasts correspond to the erythroid/megakaryocytic bipotential progenitor cells .
We have previously found a high expression of human Ah receptor ( TCDD receptor ) mRNA in peripheral blood cells of individuals .
In this paper , the expression of this gene in blood cells was first investigated in fractions of nucleated cells , revealing predominant expression of the Ah receptor gene in the monocyte fraction .
Then the expression levels of AhR mRNA in various hematopoietic cell lines were examined together with those of Arnt and P450IA1 .
AhR was expressed at high levels in monocytoid U937 , THP1 , and HEL/S cells , and at moderate levels in promyelocytic HL60 cells and erythroblastic HEL cells .
However , it was not detected in lymphoid cells MOLT4 ( T cell ) and BALL1 ( B cell ) , nor in K562 erythroblasts .
Furthermore , a specific induction of AhR during monocytic differentiation was investigated in HL60 and HEL cells .
HL60 cells were induced to differentiate toward monocytes-macrophages by incubation with phorbol ester , showing a 5- to 2-fold increase of AhR mRNA .
The incubation with transforming growth factor beta 1 and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulted in a 5- to 7-fold increase of AhR mRNA .
The HEL cells also exhibited a similar elevation of AhR mRNA level , when they had differentiated toward monocyte-macrophage cells by these combined inducers , but little change in the mRNA level was observed when the cells were induced to differentiate into other cell types .
Treatment of the differentiated HL60 cells with 3-methylcholanthrene , a ligand of AhR , induced the expression of the P450IA1 gene .
These results indicated that expression of AhR mRNA was significantly induced during monocytic differentiation and that the differentiated cells were responsive to xenobiotics .
Our results suggest that AhR may play an important role in the function of monocytes and also in the eventual activation of environmental carcinogens .
PU.1 ( the Spi-1 oncogene ) and Spi-B are closely related members of the ets transcription factor family , sharing similar DNA binding specificities mediated by similar DNA binding domains .
PU.1 and Spi-B have been previously described as being predominantly expressed coordinately in macrophages and B cells , but their expression in early hematopoietic stages and during the course of myeloid differentiation to monocytes and macrophages or to neutrophils has not been extensively investigated .
Here , we report that PU.1 mRNA is upregulated during myeloid differentiation of human purified CD34+ cells and murine multipotential FDCP-mix A4 cells , suggesting that PU.1 is upregulated as an early event during differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells .
PU.1 expression is maintained at stable levels during differentiation of myeloid cell lines U937 and HL-60 to monocytic and neutrophilic cells .
PU.1 is expressed at highest levels in mature human monocytes and human peripheral blood neutrophils .
In contrast to PU.1 , significant levels of Spi-B mRNA and protein are found only in some B-cell lines and spleen but are not found in myeloid cell lines , neutrophils , or macrophages .
In vitro translated Spi-B protein can bind to PU.1 binding sites in myeloid promoters and transactivate these promoters in nonmyeloid cells .
Therefore , although PU.1 and Spi-B may bind to similar DNA control elements and have redundancy of transactivation function in vitro , the lack of significant levels of Spi-B in myeloid cells makes it unlikely that Spi-B plays a significant role in myeloid lineage development and gene expression .
In contrast , PU.1 is expressed at high levels not only in monocytes and macrophages but also in neutrophils , indicating that PU.1 can activate gene expression in both major myeloid lineages .
The function of the zeta-globin promoter was studied using a series of zeta-globin promoter deletion constructs to drive luciferase expression in transiently transfected human erythroleukemia cells .
The promoters were used without enhancers , or with enhancers derived from the beta-globin locus control region and the alpha-globin HS-40 enhancer .
When transfected into K562 cells , which express zeta-globin , comparable amounts of activity were obtained from the -557 and -417 zeta-luciferase constructs and the alpha-luciferase constructs when no enhancers or the alpha-globin locus enhancers were used .
When the constructs were transfected into OCIM1 cells , which do not express zeta-globin , the zeta-globin promoters were at best 20 % as active as the alpha-globin promoters .
When sequences from -417 to -207 5' to the zeta-globin mRNA cap site were deleted , up to 95 % of the zeta-globin promoter activity was lost in K562 cells .
Reinsertion of these sequences into zeta-luciferase constructs missing the -417 to -207 region showed that the sequences lack classical enhancer activity .
Point mutation of a GATA-1 site at -230 reduced promoter activity by 37 % .
Point mutation of a CCACC site at -240 had no effect .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the -230 GATA-1 site has a relatively low affinity for GATA-1 .
These experiments show the presence of a strong positive-acting element , located between -417 and -207 bp 5' to the zeta-globin mRNA cap site , is necessary for high-level promoter activity in K562 cells .
This element requires GATA-1 and additional unknown factors for maximal activity .
T cells express multiple isotypes of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and although it is well accepted that PKCs have an important role in T cell activation , little is known about the function of individual PKC isotypes .
To address this issue , mutationally active PKC-alpha , -epsilon , or -zeta have been transfected into T cells and the consequences for T cell activation determined .
p21ras plays an essential role in T cell activation .
Accordingly , the effects of the constitutively active PKCs were compared to the effects of mutationally activated p21ras .
The data indicate that PKC-epsilon and , to a lesser extent PKC-alpha but not -zeta , can regulate the transcription factors AP-1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT-1 ) .
The ability of PKC-epsilon to induce transactivation of NF-AT-1 and AP-1 was similar to the stimulatory effect of a constitutively activated p21ras .
PKC-epsilon , but not PKC-alpha nor activated p21ras , was able to induce NF-KB activity .
Phorbol esters induce expression of CD69 whereas none of the activated PKC isotypes tested were able to have this effect .
Activated Src and p21ras were able to induce CD69 expression .
These results indicate selective functions for different PKC isotypes in T cells .
Moreover , the data comparing the effects of activated Ras and PKC mutants suggest that PKC-alpha , p21ras , and PKC-epsilon are not positioned linearly on a single signal transduction pathway .
Although glucocorticosteroids are a very effective treatment for asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases , a small proportion of patients are resistant to their therapeutic effects .
The molecular mechanism for this steroid resistance is unclear .
Steroid resistance can not be explained by pharmacokinetic mechanisms , by a defect in the binding of steroids to glucocorticoid receptors , nor by defective nuclear translocation of this receptor , thereby suggesting that the molecular abnormality lies distal to nuclear translocation .
We examined the ability of nuclear translocated glucocorticoid receptors to bind to their DNA binding sites ( GRE ) using electrophoretic mobility shift assays in PBMC from patients with steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant asthma .
The binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to DNA in these patients was also studied using Scatchard analysis .
Dexamethasone induced a significant rapid and sustained twofold increase in GRE binding in PBMCs from steroid-sensitive asthmatic patients and nonasthmatic individuals , but this was markedly reduced in steroid-resistant asthmatic patients .
Scatchard analysis of glucocorticoid receptor-GRE binding showed no change in binding affinity but did show a reduced number of receptors available for DNA binding in the steroid-resistant patients .
These results suggest that the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor to bind to GRE is impaired in steroid-resistant patients because of a reduced number of receptors available for binding to DNA .
Signaling by a wide variety of cytokines , including interferons , interleukins , and growth factors , involves activation of JAK kinases and Stat ( Signal transducers and activators of transcription ) proteins .
At present , not much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) exerts its diverse biologic effects .
Human eosinophils are one of the most important target cells for IL-5 and were used here to study IL-5 signaling in a primary human cell .
IL-5 induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 .
Moreover , IL-5 induced at least two DNA-binding complexes , using nuclear extracts from normal human eosinophils and the IL-6/interferon-gamma response element of the ICAM-1 promoter ( ICAM-1 pIRE ) in an electromobility shift assay .
From supershift experiments it was concluded that one DNA-binding complex contained Stat1 alpha , probably as a homodimer .
Both DNA-binding complexes were inhibited by a phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for complex formation .
IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induced , similar to IL-5 , two DNA-binding complexes in human eosinophils , including Stat1 alpha .
These data show for the first time that molecular mechanisms of IL-5 signaling in human eosinophils involve members of the JAK kinase family as well as members of the Stat family .
Tat is an essential regulatory protein for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
Mutations in the tat gene have been shown to block HIV replication in human T cells .
Several studies have established that Tat releases an elongation block to the transcription of HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ; however , it is not known whether this mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the block to HIV replication in human T cells when Tat is absent .
It is possible that Tat is also needed for other functions during HIV replication .
To test these hypotheses , we studied several tat mutants , including two stop codon mutants and one deletion mutant using replication-competent HIV-1 constructs carrying wild-type or mutant LTRs with modifications in the NF-kappa B and/or Sp1 binding sites .
In this study , we show that Tat-HIV-1 with wild-type LTRs can replicate in HeLa cells , and the virus produced from HeLa cells can infect primary peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages .
It was found that the propagation of the Tat mutants containing wild-type LTRs was less efficient than that of the LTR-modified Tat mutants .
Large amounts of viral RNA and particles were synthesized in infections established using the tat mutants that contain modified LTRs .
However , this efficient propagation of the LTR-modified tat mutants was restricted to some lymphoid cell lines that have been transformed with other viruses .
Thus , despite its essential role for releasing an elongation block , Tat is not otherwise absolutely required for synthesis of full-length HIV transcripts and assembly of virus particles .
Direct sequencing of the viral genomes and reinfection kinetics showed no evidence of wild-type reversion even after prolonged infection with the Tat-virus .
The implications for in vivo HIV-1 replication and potential application of this system to the study of alternative Tat function are discussed .
The class II major histocompatibility complex gene HLA-DRA is expressed in B cells , activated T lymphocytes , and in antigen-presenting cells .
In addition , HLA-DRA gene expression is inducible in a variety of cell types by interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) .
Here we show that the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2A plays a critical role in HLA-DRA gene expression in class II-positive B cell lines , and that the high mobility group protein ( HMG ) I/Y binds to multiple sites within the DRA promoter , including the Oct-2A binding site .
Coexpression of HMG I/Y and Oct-2 in cell lines lacking Oct-2 results in high levels of HLA-DRA gene expression , and in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal that HMG I/Y stimulates Oct-2A binding to the HLA-DRA promoter .
Thus , Oct-2A and HMG I/Y may synergize to activate HLA-DRA expression in B cells .
By contrast , Oct-2A is not involved in the IFN-gamma induction of the HLA-DRA gene in HeLa cells , but antisense HMG I/Y dramatically decreases the level of induction .
We conclude that distinct sets of transcription factors are involved in the two modes of HLA-DRA expression , and that HMG I/Y may be important for B cell-specific expression , and is essential for IFN-gamma induction .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -infected cells may sustain three distinct forms of virus latency .
In lymphoblastoid cell lines , six EBV-encoded nuclear antigens ( EBNA1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , 3C , -LP ) , three latent membrane proteins ( LMP1 , 2A , 2B ) , and two nuclear RNAs ( EBERs ) are expressed .
This form of latency , termed latency III , is also encountered in some posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders .
In EBV-positive cases of Hodgkin 's disease , the EBERs , EBNA1 , and the LMPs are expressed ( latency II ) , whereas in Burkitt 's lymphoma ( BL ) only the EBERs and EBNA1 have been detected ( latency I ) .
We have studied the expression of EBV proteins in 17 cases of EBV-positive endemic BL by immunohistology .
Expression of LMP1 was seen in variable proportions of tumor cells in two cases and EBNA2 was detected in some tumor cells in three other cases .
Also , the BZLF1 trans-activator protein was expressed in a few tumor cells in 6 cases , indicating entry into the lytic cycle .
A phenotypic drift from latency I to latency III has been observed previously in some BL cell lines .
Our results suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in BL in vivo and indicate that the operational definition of EBV latencies is not easily applied to human tumors .
The intracellular signal transduction of IL-5 in eosinophils is unknown .
The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of the newly discovered Jak-STAT pathway in the IL-5 signal transduction mechanism .
Eosinophils were purified from peripheral blood by discontinuous Percoll gradients and stimulated with IL-5 .
The involvement of Jak 2 was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation .
The activation of Jak 2 was studied by autophosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated kinase .
Jak 2 was tyrosine phosphorylated within 1 to 3 min after stimulation of eosinophils with IL-5 .
Further , the immunoprecipitated Jak 2 obtained from IL-5-stimulated cells underwent autophosphorylation .
Jak 2 coprecipitated with the beta-subunit of the IL-5 receptor , suggesting a physical association of the kinase with the receptor .
The nuclear factor STAT-1 ( p91 ) was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation .
STAT-1 was tyrosine phosphorylated within 15 min of IL-5 stimulation .
The presence of STAT-1 in the nuclear extract was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
IL-5 induced two proteins that bound to the gamma-activating sequence .
In the presence of an anti-STAT-1 Ab , the band was supershifted .
Thus , we demonstrated that IL-5 activated the Jak 2-STAT 1 signaling pathway in eosinophils .
We speculate that the Jak 2-STAT 1 pathway may be involved in the activation of IL-5-inducible genes in eosinophils .
Immunosuppression has been often associated with the course of malignant diseases .
In the present study , the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) was assessed prospectively in 90 patients with stage I-III breast cancer .
Whereas PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer preoperatively was significantly decreased when compared with data obtained in healthy control individuals ( P < 0.001 ) , the degree of the defect in PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs depended upon the tumour burden as manifested by tumour size and axillary lymph node involvement ( P < 0.003 in each case ) .
PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs dropped significantly in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide , methotrexate and fluorouracil ( CMF ) after an observation period of 6 months ( P < 0.01 ) , but not in patients under adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen only .
After an additional 6 months ( i.e. 12 months after surgery ) , PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs was similar in patients after adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF and in those receiving continued adjuvant tamoxifen treatment ( P > 0.1 ) , but in all patients still significantly decreased as compared with healthy controls ( P < 0.001 ) .
When data obtained preoperatively and after 12 months were compared , it was found that out of 23 patients whose PBMCs had experienced a drop in their PHA-induced proliferation , 14 ( 61 % ) had developed metastatic disease within the subsequent 24 months ( i.e. 36 months after surgery ) .
In contrast , out of 59 patients whose PBMCs showed an increase in their PHA-induced proliferation within the first 12 months after surgery , only one ( 2 % ) presented with disease progression .
We thus conclude that PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs derived from patients with breast cancer depends upon the tumour load and is a good clinical predictor for the further course of the disease .
A previously unrecognized element , located downstream of the start site of transcription in the first exon of the DR alpha gene , has been defined that enhances promoter activity up to eightfold in a position-dependent manner .
Mutations in this DNA-binding site abolished binding of a nuclear factor in human B cell nuclear extract and decreased the activity of the DR alpha promoter to a basal level .
Significant sequence homology of this element was found in the DNA of the DR beta , DP alpha and -beta , and DQ alpha genes , always located downstream of the transcriptional start site .
The nuclear factor binds to the DR alpha and DP alpha element but not to the element in the DQ alpha gene .
It was identified as NF-E1 ( YY1 ) .
This protein , previously identified by its binding to the Ig kappa 3' enhancer and the Ig heavy chain mu E1 site , thus also appears to be quite important in the regulation of MHC class II gene expression .
Core binding factor ( CBF ) , also known as polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 and SL3 enhancer factor 1 , is a mammalian transcription factor that binds to an element termed the core within the enhancers of the murine leukemia virus family of retroviruses .
The core elements of the SL3 virus are important genetic determinants of the ability of this virus to induce T-cell lymphomas and the transcriptional activity of the viral long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes .
CBF consists of two subunits , a DNA binding subunit , CBF alpha , and a second subunit , CBF beta , that stimulates the DNA binding activity of CBF alpha .
One of the genes that encodes a CBF alpha subunit is AML1 , also called Cbf alpha 2 .
This locus is rearranged by chromosomal translocations in human myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias .
An exogenously expressed Cbf alpha 2-encoded subunit ( CBF alpha 2-451 ) stimulated transcription from the SL3 enhancer in P19 and HeLa cells .
Activity was mediated through the core elements .
Three different isoforms of CBF beta were also tested for transcriptional activity on the SL3 enhancer .
The longest form , CBF beta-187 , increased the transcriptional stimulation by CBF alpha 2-451 twofold in HeLa cells , although it had no effect in P19 cells .
Transcriptional activation by CBF beta required binding to the CBF alpha subunit , as a form of CBF beta that lacked binding ability , CBF beta-148 , failed to increase activity .
These results indicated that at least in certain cell types , the maximum activity of CBF required both subunits .
They also provided support for the hypothesis that CBF is a factor in T lymphocytes that is responsible for recognition of the SL3 cores .
We also examined whether CBF could distinguish a 1-bp difference between the enhancer core of SL3 and the core of the nonleukemogenic virus , Akv .
This difference strongly affects transcription in T cells and leukemogenicity of SL3 .
However , no combination of CBF alpha and CBF beta subunits that we tested was able to distinguish the 1-bp difference in transcription assays .
Thus , a complete understanding of how T cells recognize the SL3 core remains to be elucidated .
Our previous studies in human monocytes have demonstrated that interleukin ( IL ) -10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -stimulated production of inflammatory cytokines , IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha by blocking gene transcription .
Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) , we now show that , in monocytes stimulated with LPS or TNF alpha , IL-10 inhibits nuclear stimulation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , a transcription factor involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes . Several other transcription factors including NF-IL-6 , AP-1 , AP-2 , GR , CREB , Oct-1 , and Sp-1 are not affected by IL-10 .
This selective inhibition by IL-10 of NF kappa B activation occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner and correlates well with IL-10 's cytokine synthesis inhibitory activity in terms of both kinetics and dose responsiveness .
Furthermore , compounds such as tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate that are known to selectively inhibit NF kappa B activation block cytokine gene transcription in LPS-stimulated monocytes .
Taken together , these results suggest that inhibition of NF kappa B activation may be an important mechanism for IL-10 suppression of cytokine gene transcription in human monocytes .
IL-4 , another cytokine that inhibits cytokine mRNA accumulation in monocytes , shows little inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NF kappa B activation .
Further examination reveals that , unlike IL-10 , IL-4 enhances mRNA degradation and does not suppress cytokine gene transcription .
These data indicate that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit cytokine production by different mechanisms .
LMP-1 , an Epstein-Barr virus membrane protein expressed during latent infection , has oncogenic properties , as judged from its ability to transform B lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts .
LMP-1 induces the expression of bcl2 , an oncogene which protects cells from apoptosis , as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control .
The mechanisms by which LMP-1 upregulates these proteins is unknown , but it is plausible that LMP-1 modifies signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of one or more transcription factors that ultimately regulate transcription of oncogenic genes .
NF-kappa B , a transcription factor controlling the expression of genes involved in cell activation and growth control , has been shown to be activated by LMP-1 .
The mechanism ( s ) regulating this activation remains unknown .
Our data indicate that increased NF-kappa B DNA binding and functional activity are present in B-lymphoid cells stably or transiently expressing LMP-1 .
I kappa B alpha is selectively modified in LMP-1-expressing B cells .
A phosphorylated form of I kappa B alpha and increased protein turnover-degradation correlate with increased NF-kappa B nuclear translocation .
This results in increased transcription of NF-kappa B-dependent-genes , including those encoding p105 and I kappa B alpha ( MAD3 ) .
These results indicate that LMP-1 activates NF-kappa B in B-cell lines by targeting I kappa B alpha .
Identification of the pathways activated by LMP-1 to result in posttranslational modifications of I kappa B alpha will aid in determining the role of this virus-host cell protein interaction in Epstein-Barr virus-mediated oncogenesis .
A DNA response element ( TR2RE-SV40 ) for the TR2 orphan receptor , a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily , has been identified in the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) +55 region ( nucleotide numbers 368-389 , 5'-GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATGGA-3' ) .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay , using in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor with a molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons , showed a specific binding with high affinity ( dissociation constant = 9 nM ) for this DNA sequence .
DNA-swap experiments using chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase assay demonstrated that androgen can suppress the transcriptional activities of SV40 early promoter via the interaction between this TR2RE-SV40 and the chimeric receptor AR/TR2/AR with the DNA-binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N-terminal and androgen-binding domains of the androgen receptor .
In addition , this TR2RE-SV40 can function as a repressor to suppress the transcriptional activities of both SV40 early and late promoters .
Together , these data suggest the TR2RE-SV40 may represent the first identified natural DNA response element for the TR2 orphan receptor that may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression .
Karyotypic detection of chromosomal 16 abnormalities classically associated with AML M4Eo can be difficult .
Characterization of the two genes involved in the inv(16)(p13q22) , CBF beta and MYH11 , has allowed the detection of fusion transcripts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .
We have analyzed CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts by RT-PCR in myelomonocytic leukemias , with or without eosinophilia , to determine whether their presence correlates with morphology .
Fifty-three cases ( 11 AML M4Eo ; 1 AML M4 with atypical abnormal eosinophils ( AML M4 " Eo " ) ; 29 AML M4 ; 8 AML M5 ; 3 CMML ; and 1 AML M2 with eosinophilia ) were analyzed .
All 11 typical AML M4Eo were CBF beta-MYH11 positive .
The single case of AML M4 with distinctive eosinophil abnormalities was negative by karyotype , RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) .
Three of 29 ( 10 % ) AML M4 without abnormal eosinophils were CBF beta-MYH11 positive , 1 of which did not show any apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical metaphase analysis ( 2 not tested ) .
Both cases tested also showed MYH11 genomic rearrangement .
None of the other leukemias were RT-PCR positive .
Follow-up of three patient showed residual positivity in apparent complete remission .
These data show that CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts occur not only in the vast majority of typical AML M4Eo , but also in approximately 10 % of AML M4 without eosinophilic abnormalities , a much higher incidence than the sporadic reports of chromosome 16 abnormalities in AML M4 would suggest .
Taken together with the detection of CBF beta-MYH11transcripts in the absence of apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical banding techniques , these data show that additional screening by either RT-PCR or FISH should be performed in all AML M4 , regardless of morphologic features , to allow accurate evaluation of the prognostic importance of this fusion transcript .
This study demonstrates that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) Tat protein amplifies the activity of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , a cytokine that stimulates HIV-1 replication through activation of NF-kappa B .
In HeLa cells stably transfected with the HIV-1 tat gene ( HeLa-tat cells ) , expression of the Tat protein enhanced both TNF-induced activation of NF-kappa B and TNF-mediated cytotoxicity .
A similar potentiation of TNF effects was observed in Jurkat T cells and HeLa cells treated with soluble Tat protein .
TNF-mediated activation of NF-kappa B and cytotoxicity involves the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates .
Therefore , Tat-mediated effects on the cellular redox state were analyzed .
In both T cells and HeLa cells HIV-1 Tat suppressed the expression of Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase ( Mn-SOD ) , a mitochondrial enzyme that is part of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress .
Thus , Mn-SOD RNA protein levels and activity were markedly reduced in the presence of Tat .
Decreased Mn-SOD expression was associated with decreased levels of glutathione and a lower ratio of reduced : oxidized glutathione .
A truncated Tat protein ( Tat1-72 ) , known to transactivate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , no longer affected Mn-SOD expression , the cellular redox state or TNF-mediated cytotoxicity .
Thus , our experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal region of HIV-1 Tat is required to suppress Mn-SOD expression and to induce pro-oxidative conditions reflected by a drop in reduced glutathione ( GSH ) and the GSH : oxidized GSH ( GSSG ) ratio .
Glucocorticoids have been included in almost all treatment regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia for decades .
However , optimal agents , doses , and/or schedules have yet to be defined despite extensive clinical application .
New data on the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and molecular mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids have suggested alternative approaches in ALL .
These suggest that prolonged , i.e. 28 day , glucocorticoid therapy may be unnecessary as exposure to glucocorticoid induces down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptors .
Dexamethasone may be superior to prednisone in conventional equi-effective doses .
Blast sensitivity to glucocorticoids correlates closely with sensitivity to other , putatively non-cross-resisting agents and with outcome after multi-agent therapy , suggesting overlapping mechanisms of action , and focusing attention on the determinants of the threshold for apoptosis .
Increasing success in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has led to increasing awareness of avascular necrosis of bone as a potentially disabling sequela of glucocorticoid therapy , especially in adolescent and young adult patients .
Expression of the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP-1 ) oncogene is regulated by the EBV nuclear protein 2 ( EBNA-2 ) transactivator .
EBNA-2 is known to interact with the cellular DNA-binding protein J kappa and is recruited to promoters containing the GTGGGAA J kappa recognition sequence .
The minimal EBNA-2-responsive LMP-1 promoter includes one J kappa-binding site , and we now show that mutation of that site , such that J kappa can not bind , reduces EBNA-2 responsiveness by 60 % .
To identify other factors which interact with the LMP-1 EBNA-2 response element ( E2RE ) , a -236/-145 minimal E2RE was used as a probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
The previously characterized factors J kappa , PU.1 , and AML1 bind to the LMP-1 E2RE , along with six other unidentified factors ( LBF2 to LBF7 ) .
Binding sites were mapped for each factor .
LBF4 is B- and T-cell specific and recognizes the PU.1 GGAA core sequence as shown by methylation interference .
LBF4 has a molecular mass of 105 kDa and is probably unrelated to PU.1 .
LBF2 was found only in epithelial cell lines , whereas LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , and LBF7 were not cell type specific .
Mutations of the AML1- or LBF4-binding sites had no effect on EBNA-2 transactivation , whereas mutation of the PU.1-binding site completely eliminated EBNA-2 responses .
A gst-EBNA-2 fusion protein specifically depleted PU.1 from nuclear extracts and bound in vitro translated PU.1 , providing biochemical evidence for a direct EBNA-2-PU.1 interaction .
Thus , EBNA-2 transactivation of the LMP-1 promoter is dependent on interaction with at least two distinct sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins , J kappa and PU.1 .
LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , or LBF7 may also be involved , since their binding sites also contribute to EBNA-2 responsiveness .
Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adolescents demonstrates resistance to tricyclic antidepressants and absence of hypercortisolemia .
The efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SRIs ) is uncertain , and response predictors are unavailable .
Abnormal fast feedback and negative feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis implicates a dampened limbic-hippocampal glucocorticoid type II receptor ( GCII ) .
We hypothesized that lymphocyte GCII is altered in adolescent MDD and could serve as a marker for response to SRIs .
In an open-label study , adolescents ( n = 20 ) meeting DSM-III-R criteria for MDD showed baseline lymphocyte GCII sites per cell ( sites/cell ) values of 793 +/- 106 versus 2 , 563 +/- 499 ( +/- SEM ) for matched controls ( n = 18 ) ( t = 3.5 ; df = 36 ; p < .001 ) .
GCII was bimodally distributed , with SRI responders differing from nonresponders ( t = 3.9 ; df = 14 ; p < .001 ) .
GCII accurately classified 90 percent of sertraline responders and 80 percent of nonresponders .
Only SRI responders showed GCII sites/cell upregulated after 6 weeks of treatment ( t = 2.1 , df = 10 ; p < .05 ) .
The tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF alpha ) gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells , in that it is rapidly induced without a requirement for protein synthesis .
Maximal induction of TNF alpha mRNA can be induced by treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores alone , via a calcineurin-dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A .
We have previously identified a promoter element , kappa 3 , that is required for calcium-stimulated , cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of the TNF alpha gene in activated T cells .
Here , we demonstrate that the kappa 3 binding factor contains NFATp , a cyclosporin-sensitive DNA-binding protein required for interleukin-2 gene transcription .
NFATp binds to two sites within the kappa 3 element , and occupancy of both sites is required for TNF alpha gene induction .
Thus , although the kappa 3 element has little sequence similarity to other NFATp-binding sites , it appears to function as a cyclosporin-sensitive promoter element in T cells by virtue of its ability to bind NFATp .
The involvement of NFATp in transcriptional activation of both the interleukin-2 and TNF alpha genes suggests that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple cytokine genes , starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation .
The expression of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen ( MNDA ) was observed specifically in cells of the granulocyte-macrophage lineage in our earlier reports .
The specificity of MNDA expression for cells in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage was reexamined in cell lines established from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia .
Cell lines that expressed MNDA exhibited myeloid cell features and granulocyte or monocyte differentiation could be induced in vitro , while cell lines exhibiting properties of very early stage cells or multipotential cells did not express MNDA .
Cells originating from cases of Burkitt 's lymphoma were negative .
By contrast , three lymphoblastoid cell lines ( immortalized in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus ) were weakly positive and MNDA was up-regulated by interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) treatment .
As we reported previously , MNDA mRNA level in adherent monocytes is elevated by IFN-alpha ; in this study , we further assessed MNDA expression in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages .
Three additional agents ( endotoxin , phytohemagglutinin , and phorbol ester ) and other conditions that affect function , cytokine production , differentiation , and/or growth of monocytes were examined for their ability to alter MNDA expression .
The results varied with the agent , cell type , and stage of differentiation .
Changes in MNDA expression occurred slowly ( hours to days ) , suggesting that MNDA could mediate changes realized over a long period .
The results also reveal a discordance in certain MNDA positive cells between steady-state levels or changes in levels of protein and mRNA indicating that the regulation of MNDA expression occurs at more than one point .
Changes in MNDA expression are consistent with a role in opposing macrophage differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages .
The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA-2 ) protein is essential for the immortalization of human primary B cells by EBV .
EBNA-2 trans-activates cellular and viral genes like CD23 , c-fgr , latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) and terminal protein 1 ( TP1 ) .
Trans-activation of the TP1 promoter and of the BamHI C promoter has already been investigated in detail and appears to be mediated via protein-protein interactions and not by direct binding of EBNA-2 type A ( of EBV type 1 ) to the DNA .
EBNA-2 is able to trans-activate the expression of the LMP gene in several cell lines .
Various reports have delineated the cis-acting elements of the LMP promoter through which EBNA-2 mediates trans-activation .
To determine whether EBNA-2 also trans-activates the LMP promoter by protein-protein interactions , we performed a series of gel retardation assays and competition experiments with LMP promoter fragments of different sizes .
We determined that the protein-binding region on the LMP promoter was within a 42 bp fragment encompassing nucleotides -135 to -176 relative to the LMP transcriptional start site .
None of the DNA fragments investigated indicated interaction of EBNA-2 with the DNA via protein-protein interactions .
No significant differences between EBNA-2-positive and EBNA-2-negative nuclear extracts could be seen in the gel retardation assay under conditions that clearly showed binding of EBNA-2A to the TP1 promoter .
However , analysis of sucrose gradient fractions in the gel retardation assay provided evidence that the LMP promoter-binding proteins form a complex of higher M(r) in EBNA-2-positive cell extracts .
These complexes were destroyed by detergent .
We deduce from these results that EBNA-2-positive cells might indeed contain specific complexes bound to the LMP promoter which are , however , too labile to be detected in a standard gel retardation assay .
Terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells in vivo is characterized by secretion of Ig and extinction of MHC class II expression on the cell surface .
We show that IL-6 signaling leads to marked increases in the synthesis and secretion of Ig in clonal human B cell lines and newly isolated polyclonal B lymphocytes in vitro .
The IL-6-induced cells resemble plasma cells in ultrastructure and in reduced expression of surface MHC class II .
Enhanced Ig synthesis is a result of coordinated transcriptional activation of Ig genes without promoter or isotype specificity , and differential accumulation of the mRNA encoding the secreted form of Ig heavy chain .
It is saturable and subject to negative control when IL-6 stimulation is prolonged .
Coordinate with temporal changes in Ig synthesis , the DNA-binding activity and the synthesis of the B cell-enriched transcription factor Oct-2 are regulated .
Thus , differentiation of B cells with IL-6 in vitro recapitulates the hallmarks of terminal B differentiation in vivo ; Oct-2 may have a role in this process .
The human interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) gene is expressed almost exclusively in activated T cells .
Its expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level .
We have previously shown that treatment of Jurkat T cells with phytohemaglutinin ( PHA ) and the phorbol ester , PMA , activated transcription initiation from the IL-3 gene .
To define the regions of the gene required for transcription activation , we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different regions of the IL-3 gene 5' and 3' flanking sequences .
Both positive and negative regulatory elements were identified in the proximal 5' flanking region of the IL-3 gene .
The promoter region between -173 and -60 contained the strongest activating elements .
The transcription factor AP-1 could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter .
We also examined the function of the IL-3 CK-1/CK-2 elements that are present in many cytokine genes and found that they acted as a repressor of basal level expression when cloned upstream of a heterologous promoter but were also inducible by PMA/PHA .
The PEBP2 alpha A and PEBP2 alpha B genes encode the DNA-binding subunit of a murine transcription factor , PEBP2 , which is implicated as a T-cell-specific transcriptional regulator .
These two related genes share the evolutionarily conserved region encoding the Runt domain .
PEBP2 alpha B is the murine counterpart of human AML1 , which is located at the breakpoints of the 8;21 and 3;21 chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia .
Northern ( RNA ) blots of various adult mouse tissues revealed that the levels of expression of both genes were most prominent in the thymus .
Furthermore , transcripts of PEBP2 alpha A and mouse AML1/PEBP2 alpha B were detected in T lymphocytes in the thymuses from day 16 embryos and newborns , as well as 4-week-old adult mice , by in situ hybridization .
The expression of the genes persisted in peripheral lymph nodes of adult mice .
The transcripts were detected in all the CD4- CD8- , CD4+ CD8+ , CD4+ CD8- , and CD4- CD8+ cell populations .
The results indicated that both genes are expressed in T cells throughout their development , supporting the notion that PEBP2 is a T-cell-specific transcription factor .
Transcripts of mouse AML1/PEBP2 alpha B were also detected in day 12 fetal hematopoietic liver and in the bone marrow cells of newborn mice .
The implication of mouse AML1/PEBP2 alpha B expression in hematopoietic cells other than those of T-cell lineage is discussed in relation to myeloid leukemogenesis .
Glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on inflammatory and immune responses , and this may be through the modulation of transcription factor binding to DNA .
The interaction of the transcription factors , activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , and cAMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) with DNA and glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gel mobility shift assays .
TNF-alpha , IL-1 beta and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) treatment increased AP-1 and NF kappa B DNA binding by up to 200 % but decreased CREB binding ( 38 % ) over a 60-min time course .
Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in glucocorticoid response element binding and a concomitant 40-50 % decrease in AP-1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and cytokine or PMA treatment .
These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of GR , not to reduced amounts of the other transcription factors .
This suggests that in these cells GR within the nucleus interacts with cytokine-stimulated transcription factors by the process of cross coupling .
This may be an important molecular site of steroid action .
Stimulation of human CD4+ T-cell clones through the T-cell receptor ( TcR ) by high doses of specific peptide results in the induction of a long-lived state of nonresponsiveness that has been called anergy .
During the induction of anergy , T cells are phenotypically similar to cells responding to an immunogenic stimulus .
The amount of TcR at the cell surface is downmodulated , whereas the CD2 and CD25 receptors are increased .
When restimulated , however , anergic T cells fail to up-regulate transcription of the IL-2 gene and in consequence do not produce IL-2 .
In this study , we have compared the ability of various transcription factors to bind to their appropriate site on DNA .
Factors were isolated from the nuclei of T cells that were in the induction phase of anergy or were undergoing activation .
The pattern of binding activity in restimulated T cells is consistent with the pattern that has previously been shown to regulate T-cell-specific expression of the IL-2 and the beta chain of the TcR genes .
The measured binding to a TCF-1 site is the same in the nuclei of resting , activated , and anergized cells .
The inducible factors NK-kappa B , beta E2 , CD28RC , and AP-1 are not expressed in resting cells and are twofold lower in anergized as compared with activated cells .
In contrast , anergic T cells express approximately eightfold lower amounts of NF-AT , a member of the class of inducible factors that regulates IL-2 gene transcription .
A trace element preparation ( Beres Drops Plus , BDP ) elevates the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( gcR ) in peripheral lymphocytes isolated both from healthy blood donors and rheumatoid arthritis patients .
This enhancement by BDP was found either for constitutive expression of gcRs or in experiments when the lymphocytes were stimulated by interleukin ( IL ) -6 .
There was no significant effect of BDP on IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) -induced changes of gcRs .
The effect of BDP was greatly dependent on the presence of Zn++ ions in the preparation , since the augmenting effect was abolished if BDP did not contain zinc .
The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor could account for the increasing unresponsiveness of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) to combination chemotherapy .
The receptor was tested immunocytochemically , in steroid binding assays , and by a mutation screening ( denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ) of the receptor-cDNA .
The receptor concentration , as measured by staining and steroid binding test , varied considerably but showed no clear correlation to clinical response .
Using a highly sensitive mutation screening assay of the DNA- and the steroid-binding region , none of the treated patients revealed any mutation , suggesting that the glucocorticoid receptor in the CLL patients tested is not altered in these domains .
In one individual who had not been treated before analysis a silent mutation was found in one receptor allele .
The results suggest that mechanisms other than altered ligand or DNA binding of the receptor may be responsible for the lack of response to chemotherapy .
This conclusion is discussed in relation to the mechanism of corticoid resistance in mouse and human lymphoma cells in culture .
Expression of the kappa immunoglobulin light chain gene requires developmental- and tissue-specific regulation by trans-acting factors which interact with two distinct enhancer elements .
A new protein-DNA interaction has been identified upstream of the intron enhancer , within the matrix-associated region of the J-C intron .
The binding activity is greatly inducible in pre-B cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-1 but specific complexes are found at all stages of B cell development tested .
The footprinted binding site is homologous to the consensus AP1 motif .
The protein components of this complex are specifically competed by an AP1 consensus motif and were shown by supershift to include c-Jun and c-Fos , suggesting that this binding site is an AP1 motif and that the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors play a role in the regulation of the kappa light chain gene .
Mutation of the AP1 motif in the context of the intron enhancer was shown to decrease enhancer-mediated activation of the promoter in both pre-B cells induced with LPS and constitutive expression in mature B cells .
The tal-1 gene , frequently activated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , is expressed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages during normal hematopoiesis .
To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal-1 expression , we investigated tal-1 chromatin structure in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and in T-cell lines either with or without tal-1 rearrangements .
Tal-1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T-cell line that expresses tal-1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus .
Methylation studies indicated that the tal-15 ' GC-rich region behaves like a CpG island , hypomethylated in normal cells , and methylated de novo on transcriptionally inactive alleles in established cell lines .
Five major DNase-I hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped in the tal-1 locus .
HS I , IV , and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal-1 from the promoters 1a and 1b .
HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines , absent in Hela , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis-activation of tal-1 promoter 1b in this cell line .
HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat , and greatly enhanced in DU528 , a T-cell line that bears a t(1;14) and initiates tal-1 transcription within exon 4 .
These results suggest that distinct regulatory elements are associated with the use of the different tal-1 promoters .
M-TAT is a cytokine-dependent cell line with the potential to differentiate along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages .
We cultured M-TAT cells long term ( > 1 year ) in the continuous presence of erythropoietin ( EPO ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , or stem cell factor ( SCF ) .
These long term cultures are referred to as M-TAT/EPO , M-TAT/GM-CSF , and M-TAT/SCF cells , respectively .
Hemoglobin concentration and gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA levels were significantly higher in M-TAT/EPO cells than in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells .
When the supplemented cytokine was switched from GM-CSF to EPO , hemoglobin synthesis in M-TAT/GM-CSF cells increased rapidly ( within 5 h ) , and the level of GATA-1 mRNA increased .
In contrast , the addition of GM-CSF to the M-TAT/EPO cell culture decreased the amount of hemoglobin , even in the presence of EPO , indicating that the EPO signal for erythroid differentiation is suppressed by GM-CSF .
Thus , erythroid development of M-TAT cells is promoted by EPO and suppressed by GM-CSF .
These results support the hypothesis that EPO actively influences the programming of gene expression required for erythroid progenitor cell differentiation .
cdc2 mRNA transcripts were detected in immature bone marrow cells and became undetectable along with differentiation .
Peripheral blood resting cells did not express cdc2 mRNA , but it was induced in T-lymphocytes when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to specific mitogens .
In contrast , cdc2 mRNA could not be induced in granulocytes and monocytes even after the culture with the appropriate stimulants .
In order to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells , we isolated the 5'-flanking sequence of the cdc2 gene and found the putative E2F binding site at the position of nucleotides -124 to -117 .
The binding of E2F at this region was detected by a gel-retardation assay and DNaseI footprinting in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T-lymphocytes , which was coincident with the expression of cdc2 mRNA .
E2F binding was not observed in both granulocytes and monocytes .
Transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed that the region containing E2F binding site had a strong promoter activity , and introduction of the mutation at the E2F binding site resulted in a significant loss of the activity .
E2F-1 and DP-1 mRNAs were not detectable in granulocytes , monocytes and resting T-lymphocytes but were induced after the mitogenic stimulation of T-lymphocytes .
The induction of E2F activity preceded the appearance of cdc2 mRNA , which is consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression .
These results suggest that cdc2 mRNA expression is related to the cell cycling of normal human hematopoietic cells and that E2F plays some roles in the regulation of its expression .
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) replication is controlled by a complex array of virally encoded and cellular proteins .
A wide spectrum of levels of HIV-1 expression have been demonstrated in various cells , both in cell culture and in vivo .
Molecular mechanisms leading to restricted HIV-1 replication may differ between certain cell types .
It is now demonstrated that HIV-1 proviral latency in the monocytic cell line U1 , in which only extremely low levels of HIV-1 expression are detected in the baseline unstimulated state , is associated with alterations in nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappa B ) moieties demonstrated in these cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in situ UV cross-linking studies .
A predominance of p50 NF-kappa B moieties and possibly p50 homodimers or closely related species , rather than the p50-p56 heterodimer of NF-kappa B that is the predominant NF-kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells , is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells .
This pattern of NF-kappa B-related moieties differs from the latently infected T lymphocytic cell line ACH-2 , and from the U937 monocytic line , the parental cell line of the U1 cellular clone .
As such , these data suggest that different proximal mechanisms may lead to restricted HIV-1 replication in various cell types .
Since most B cell clones immortalized with EBV virus can be induced to produce interleukin-2 , a typical T cell cytokine , we studied the role of different elements of the IL-2 promoter in such clones by transfection .
It was found , in particular , that the element TCEd , which binds the transcription factor NF-kB , is very active in all three B clones tested .
This element has no activity in T cells of the Jurkat line .
The NFATd element , which binds the transcription factor NFAT-1 and is very active in T cells , is only weakly active in one B clone and not at all in another .
Different elements thus contribute to IL-2 promoter activity in different cells .
The mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in human monocytes/macrophages are partially understood .
Persistent HIV infection of U937 monocytic cells results in NF-kappa B activation .
Whether virus-induced NF-kappa B activation is a mechanism that favors continuous viral replication in macrophages remains unknown .
To further delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of NF-kappa B in HIV-infected monocytes and macrophages , we have focused on the regulation of the I kappa B molecules .
First , we show that persistent HIV infection results in the activation of NF-kappa B not only in monocytic cells but also in macrophages .
In HIV-infected cells , I kappa B alpha protein levels are decreased secondary to enhanced protein degradation .
This parallels the increased I kappa B alpha synthesis secondary to increased I kappa B alpha gene transcription , i.e. , increased RNA and transcriptional activity of its promoter-enhancer .
Another protein with I kappa B function , p105 , is also modified in HIV-infected cells : p105 and p50 steady-state protein levels are increased as a result of increased synthesis and proteolytic processing of p105 .
Transcriptional activity of p105 is also increased in infected cells and is also mediated by NF-kappa B through a specific kappa B motif .
These results demonstrate the existence of a triple autoregulatory loop in monocytes and macrophages involving HIV , p105 and p50 , and MAD3 , with the end result of persistent NF-kappa B activation and viral persistence .
Furthermore , persistent HIV infection of monocytes and macrophages provides a useful model with which to study concomitant modifications of different I kappa B molecules .
Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes , which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in various diseases including leukemia , depends on the glucocorticoid receptor .
However , the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are not understood .
A prevailing hypothesis postulates induction of so-called ' lysis genes ' by the activated receptor .
In this study , we show that an activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant is as effective as the wild-type receptor in repression of AP-1 activity , inhibition of interleukin-2 production , inhibition of c-myc expression and induction of apoptosis .
Furthermore , we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor , whose repressive functions but not target site specificity , are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor .
Therefore , the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression rather than activation and could be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival .
NF-kappa B is a nuclear protein of the rel oncogene family capable of enhancing transcription of several cellular genes , including IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor , and viral genes transcribed from the HIV-1 LTR .
It has been reported that HIV-1 protease may cleave the NF-kappa B precursor to its active form in vitro .
In this study the effects of HIV protease on NF-kappa B precursor activation were examined in Jurkat T cells by introducing a protease expression vector into the cells .
Increased NF-kappa B activity was observed and this increased activity was blocked by a specific inhibitor of the viral protease .
Viral transcription , as measured using LTR-CAT assays , was only slightly enhanced in the HIV-protease expressing cells , while secretion of IL-2 and expression of the IL-2 receptor were not affected .
The limited activation of NF-kappa B by HIV protease appears unlikely to have a significant effect on virus expression or T cell function .
We have examined the feasibility of using interferon ( IFN ) gene transfer as a novel approach to anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) therapy in this study .
To limit expression of a transduced HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) -IFNA2 ( the new approved nomenclature for IFN genes is used throughout this article ) hybrid gene to the HIV-1-infected cells , HIV-1 LTR was modified .
Deletion of the NF-kappa B elements of the HIV-1 LTR significantly inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation in T-cell lines , as well as in a monocyte line , U937 .
Replacement of the NF-kappa B elements in the HIV-1 LTR by a DNA fragment derived from the 5'-flanking region of IFN-stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) , containing the IFN-stimulated response element , partially restored Tat-mediated activation of LTR in T cells as well as in monocytes .
Insertion of this chimeric promoter ( ISG15 LTR ) upstream of the human IFNA2 gene directed high levels of IFN synthesis in Tat-expressing cells , while this promoter was not responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated activation .
ISG15-LTR-IFN hybrid gene inserted into the retrovirus vector was transduced into Jurkat and U937 cells .
Selected transfected clones produced low levels of IFN A ( IFNA ) constitutively , and their abilities to express interleukin-2 and interleukin-2 receptor upon stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate were retained .
Enhancement of IFNA synthesis observed upon HIV-1 infection resulted in significant inhibition of HIV-1 replication for a period of at least 30 days .
Virus isolated from IFNA-producing cells was able to replicate in the U937 cells but did not replicate efficiently in U937 cells transduced with the IFNA gene .
These results suggest that targeting IFN synthesis to HIV-1-infected cells is an attainable goal and that autocrine IFN synthesis results in a long-lasting and permanent suppression of HIV-1 replication .
Human cDNAs encoding Kruppel-type zinc finger domains , designated KOX 1-32 , have been cloned from human T lymphocyte cell line libraries .
We report here the regional localizations by in situ hybridization of KOX 18 and KOX 25 on chromosome bands 7q21q22 .
Pulse-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) analysis showed that these genes are physically located within a DNA fragment of 250 kb .
The genes KOX 4 and KOX 9 , mapped on chromosome 8q24 , were found to be located within a DNA fragment of 450 kb .
From the present and previous data , eighteen different KOX genes have been located at least two by two within nine DNA fragments of 200 to 580 kb .
This study investigated age-related T cell responses after in vitro exposure to influenza A virus .
Mononuclear leukocytes from young or elderly persons were sham-exposed or exposed to influenza virus for 1 , 24 , and 72 h .
Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis were then used to detect T cells producing the transcriptional regulating proteins Fos and Jun .
Fewer virus-exposed cells from elderly donors stained for Fos and Jun at each data point compared with cells from young donors .
Flow cytometric analysis also showed that at 72 h of virus exposure fewer T cells from the elderly produced interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , suggesting a link between the magnitude of the Fos and Jun and IFN-gamma responses .
Thus , failure of virus-exposed T cells to produce Fos and Jun could contribute to the increase in illness due to influenza virus in the elderly .
OBJECTIVES : To analyze the effect of retinoic acids ( RA ) on HIV-1 expression and correlate this effect with expression levels of RA receptors ( RARs ) in T-lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines .
DESIGN AND METHODS : The effect of all-trans and 9-cis RA on HIV-1 production in T-lymphoid ( H9 , CEM ) and monocytoid ( U937 , THP-1 ) cell lines was measured during acute and chronic infection .
The expression levels of human RAR alpha ( hRAR alpha , receptor for all-trans RA ) and the human retinoid-X receptor alpha ( hRXR alpha receptor for 9-cis RA ) were determined by Northern blot analysis .
RESULTS : Both all-trans and 9-cis RA inhibited virus replication in HIV-1 IIIB-infected monocytoid cells , in the presence and absence of the co-stimulatory agent phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) .
The retinoids had weak or no stimulatory effects on HIV production by T-cell lines .
HIV production by PMA-stimulated T-cell lines was inhibited by these retinoids .
The 9-cis RA was generally more effective than all-trans RA in inhibiting HIV production and in combination generally more effective than the single agents alone .
Human RAR alpha was expressed in H9 , U937 and THP-1 cells , but almost undetectable in CEM cells .
Human RXR alpha was significantly expressed in U937 and THP-1 cells , weakly expressed in H9 cells and not detectable in CEM cells .
